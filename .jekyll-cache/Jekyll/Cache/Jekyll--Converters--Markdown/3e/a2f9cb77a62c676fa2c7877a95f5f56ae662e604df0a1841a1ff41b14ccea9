I"c<p>Throughout Mod 0 you will have many opportunities to practice the information you learn. One of the ways we have you reflect on your learnings is by answering CFU (Check For Understanding) questions.
At the end of each live lesson and homework lesson, there will be a set of CFUs for you to respond to. To track these responses, we will have you create a Mod 0 Gist which you will submit at the end of this prework section. You will be able to add to this gist throughout Mod 0 and instructors will be able to see those updates.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-mod-0-gist">Creating Your Mod 0 Gist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Please create a new Gist in Github, entitled Mod 0 Gist.</li>
  <li>Each lesson and homework section will instruct you on what to title each section within your gist so instructors can easily reference your progress.</li>
</ol>
