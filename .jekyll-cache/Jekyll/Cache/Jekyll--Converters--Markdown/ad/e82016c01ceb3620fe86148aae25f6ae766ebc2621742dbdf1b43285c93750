<p>During projects, it is important that you meet with your team to discuss the progress of your project, as well as, at the end of the project reflecting on its completion. These retros provide an opportunity to acknowledge what is working well so you can consciously continue doing what works. It is also important to recognize what is not working or needs improvement, so those issues can be addressed and the whole team can collaborate on a solution.</p>

<p>Below are questions that everyone should address together as a team. Your team may choose to use a tool like <a href="https://easyretro.io/">EasyRetro</a> to capture teammates’ ideas and vote on topics to spark conversation. If you have a gist where you’ve been keeping your feedback notes, include notes from your discussion there. Otherwise, there are no deliverables for this activity.</p>

<p>The questions below are not the only format a retrospective can take! Check out <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/content/retrospective-templates">this page</a> for more templates.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Retros are typically not the time to discuss constructive feedback for one individual, but rather to discuss team processes as a whole. Individual feedback is essential, but should be shared privately in direct 1-on-1 conversations instead. However, following the “praise in public” principle, team shout-outs to celebrate an individual’s job well done is a great idea in a retro!</p>
