<h3 id="ideas-from-instructors">Ideas from Instructors</h3>

<h4 id="license-plate-messenger">License Plate Messenger</h4>

<p>Could we upload a picture of a license plate and leave a message for the driver(s) (not while driving of course!); use IBM Watson for sentiment analysis for whether the message is mean or not.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Vision API is free for 1000 calls per month</li>
  <li>Cloudmersive has 50,000 free images</li>
  <li>Microsoft Computer Vision is 5000 free images</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pantryrecipe-quick-grocery-run">Pantry/Recipe ‚Äúquick grocery run‚Äù</h4>

<p>Ian‚Äôs unscientific survey (sample size: himself) shows that without a plan, wandering around a grocery store for long durations (a) exposes you to COVID-19 risks, and (b) makes you overspend on things you didn‚Äôt really need, and (c) you‚Äôre likely to forget some of the critical things you went to the store to purchase in the first place.</p>

<p>Users can track what‚Äôs in their pantry/fridge/freezer (bar code scanning maybe?), then search a database of recipes of meals they would like to make for the week. The app will scan the recipes, and generate a shopping list, but also use Kroger‚Äôs grocery API to track where in the store these ingredients are found (ie, aisle numbers), to allow users to optimize their trip. Spend less, get out faster.</p>

<h4 id="whose-turn-is-it-to-do-chores">Whose turn is it to do chores?</h4>

<p>Roommates add each other to a living space, then set up regular chores. Chores are added to each user‚Äôs Google Calendar on alternating time periods to trade off whose turn it is to, say, clean the bathroom every 3rd day, track how long the chore should take. Second API could be to find a playlist of songs while working on the task (secondary OAuth through Spotify, for example), or send an SMS reminder (not through Google Calendar reminders)</p>

<h4 id="holidaybirthdayanniversary-gift-lists">Holiday/birthday/anniversary gift lists</h4>

<p>Users can build wishlists with URLs to items they want from multiple sites (ie, Amazon, Etsy, etc); family members and friends can friend each other in the app (maybe we scan the user‚Äôs gmail account to link others who are registered on the site?), they can see your list of gift ideas, search for product reviews based on the item, and choose to buy the item, or split the cost with others; family members can see who is ‚Äòreserving‚Äô a gift or splitting the cost, but original person will not know. Perhaps set a calendar event for when to order the gift so it arrives in time for that holiday. Send notices to other family/friends via group email, perhaps.</p>
