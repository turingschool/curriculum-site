<h2 id="what-is-accessibility">What is accessibility?</h2>

<p>Accessibility on the web is all about creating a user experience that is available to anyone and everyone. We want to enable as many people as possible to use our applications, even when those users may be limited in some way.</p>

<p>The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability.</p>

<section class="note">
  <h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3>

  <p>This means that any new specifications or enhancements that come to the web are BY DEFAULT designed to be fully accessible to a complete audience.</p>
</section>

<p>Unfortunately, developers often use the tools we‚Äôre given in the wrong ways, unknowingly (or uncaringly) effecting the accessibility of their site in a negative way.</p>

<p>A quick example: not using semantic HTML tags. If you were to use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> instead of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">article</code> to wrap text for a news article, that means infinitely less to someone relying on a screen reader.</p>

<p>But for some reason we do it anyway!! So the good few souls out there that are really pushing for accessibility have even added additional attributes and APIs you can use to allow you to write your code the way you want, and still make it accessible.</p>

<p>e.g. if you really wanted to use your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> tag instead of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">article</code> tag, you could do something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div role="article"&gt;</code> and this would provide that same accessibility feedback as if you had used an article tag.</p>

<p>So we have all the tools to make our applications very accessible. While we won‚Äôt learn about all of them just yet, we will learn about what types of accessibility concerns actually exist, and gain some understanding of how others might be interacting with the web.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Watch the following <a href="https://youtu.be/qdB8SRhqvFc?t=417" target="blank">video to see how a screen reader understands a page</a> from <strong>6:57 to the 9:40</strong> mark.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Using the built-in screen reader on your machine, VoiceOver, close your eyes and navigate through the following two codepens, one at a time:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/damwhit/full/JZmeqQ" target="blank">Non-Semantic HTML Form</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://codepen.io/damwhit/full/WyaMaQ" target="blank">Semantic HTML Form</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some helpful VoiceOver commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Starting/Stopping VoiceOver:</strong> command + F5 (if you do not have an F5 key, you can navigate to Ô£ø &gt; System Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; VoiceOver &gt; Enable VoiceOver)</li>
    <li><strong>Moving your VoiceOver cursor:</strong> control + option + arrow key (ie. control + option + right arrow)</li>
    <li><strong>Moving your VoiceOver cursor into your web page‚Äôs content:</strong> control + option + shift + down arrow</li>
    <li><strong>Moving your VoiceOver cursor out of your web page‚Äôs content:</strong> control + option + shift + up arrow</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Note: use your screen reader very slowly, and really listen to what it‚Äôs telling you. It will remind you of the commands to enter/navigate a particular piece of content.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
  <ul>

<h2 id="wai-aria">WAI-ARIA</h2>

<p>Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics" target="blank">WAI-ARIA</a> is a set of <strong>attributes</strong>  we can add to our HTML tags to make our code more semantically meaningful for screen readers.</p>

<p>Think about the information provided by a set of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags. What do we know about the content within those tags? Really, we know nothing. It‚Äôs a semantically void element that controls the APPEARANCE of its content - by default it is a block style element, but beyond that it could theoretically be literally any kind of data - a title, a paragraph, an image, a random red decorative sidebar‚Ä¶etc.</p>

<p>ARIA provides a series of tools and approaches to enhancing the meaning of your code. Today we will look at the three main aspects of ARIA - Roles, States, and Properties.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Roles</strong></li>
  <li><strong>States</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Properties</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>An element can only have one role at a time, but can have as many properties and states as necessary</em></p>

<p>An important point about WAI-ARIA attributes is that they don‚Äôt affect the appearance or functionality of a web page, except for the information exposed by the browser‚Äôs accessibility APIs (where screen readers get their information from). WAI-ARIA doesn‚Äôt affect webpage structure, the DOM, etc., although the attributes can be useful for selecting elements by CSS.</p>

<section class="call-to-action">
  <p>What are some attributes you might put on an HTML element that don‚Äôt show up on the page?</p>
</section>

<!-- ![Aria Tree](/assets/images/aria.jpg) -->

<h4 id="rules-of-aria-use">Rules of ARIA Use</h4>
<p>The core rules to keep in mind when using ARIA are:</p>

<p>If you can use native HTML elements and attributes to communicate the proper semantics (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code> etc.) and then do so. Adding ARIA support where it‚Äôs not needed is <strong>redundant code</strong> that isn‚Äôt doing anything. For the most part it won‚Äôt lead to problems, but it is a waste of time, and will annoy your screen reader users.</p>

<p><strong>Many ‚Äúaccessibility flags‚Äù come from developers <em>overusing</em> ARIA. Only use ARIA as a last resort!!</strong></p>

<h2 id="aria-roles-states-and-properties">Aria Roles, States, and Properties</h2>

<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>

<p>Roles define what an element is - what function it serves on the page. They give screen readers more information about how to interact with the element (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What am I?</code>)</p>

<p>These can be either <strong>implicit</strong> or <strong>explicit</strong>.</p>

<p>Implicit roles are those that are pre-defined by default in HTML. Ie: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>. The semantic meanings of these elements are already clear by the element themselves and assistive technologies have this information too.</p>

<p>If you are writing good semantic HTML, the role will likely be implicit. Remember you can always check the role <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance" target="blank">here</a></p>

<p>Implicit Role Example:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Hello World<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- The above markup has an implicit role of "heading level 1" --&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;nav&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- The above markup has an implicit role of "navigation" --&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Explicit Role Example:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">role=</span><span class="s">'search'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</span>
A form element has a role of 'form' by default. We can override that role using the `role` attribute and providing it another value. Like in the case above where we are using the role of search.
</code></pre></div></div>

<section class="call-to-action">
  <h3 id="in-groups">In Groups</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance" target="blank">Table of elements and their implicit roles</a> and look up the following elements and their implicit roles
      <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;form&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;input&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Check out some of the other elements. Is there anything surprising?</li>
    <li>Take turns explaining what a role is.</li>
    <li>What is the difference between implicit and explicit roles?</li>
    <li>BONUS: Can you think of other examples for when we might want to override a default role?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<h2 id="states">States</h2>

<p>States describe how you are interacting with an element (What am I doing right now?) and rely on <em>boolean logic</em>.</p>

<p>For example, think about websites that have a sidebar menu that can be toggled open or closed. You might see something like this:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;button&gt;</span>
  Toggle Menu
<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we have a button with text that says ‚ÄúToggle Menu‚Äù, probably indicating that when you click on said button it will toggle the menu open or closed.</p>

<p>What this doesn‚Äôt tell you is if the menu is already open or closed, which is fine if you are a sighted user, but probably not great if you use assistive technology.</p>

<p>Luckily ARIA provides state information that we can add to our markup.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;button</span>
  <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"menu-button"</span>
  <span class="na">aria-expanded=</span><span class="s">"true"</span>
<span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  Toggle Menu
<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">button</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">menu-button</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">button</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">click</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">attr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">button</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">getAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">aria-expanded</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">attr</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">true</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="nx">button</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">setAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">aria-expanded</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="nx">button</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">setAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">aria-expanded</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also allows you to target these elements using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria-expanded</code> attribute when interacting with them in your JavaScript or CSS.</p>

<p>States can also be implicit, imagine a checkbox element in html. If you toggle the checked property that state will change as well.</p>
