## Overview
Mod 4 is focused on helping students develop good habits and processes for the job hunt, as well as, on the job professional skills. Students work together on projects to refine communication and collaboration techniques, practice intermediate level technical skills, and implement best practices for developing mature applications. Schedules are balanced with both technical focus and professional development to allow students opportunities to grow in their technical competencies while providing structure and support for finding their first job. By the end of Mod 4, our goal is for students to feel confident about interviewing and working on the job.
