# Warmup

* When someone says ...
-  "Wow, that developers portfolio is really polished!" OR
-  "(insert name) just isn't really polished"
... what does that mean to you? What are some examples of evidence they may have used to come to this?

---

# Many of these may be obvious to you...

- Many projects are littered with issues!
- But there are many opportunities to make amazing software a reality.
- The exercise of building software is never ending.

---

# Error Handling

- Human readable errors are important!
- This includes error handling on the frontend and on the backend
- Focus on the user experience

---

# Validations

Client side: Let this be your first guard against the user doing something they aren’t supposed to do.

Server side: This let be your last line of defense if client side validations fail for some reason.

# Navigation and standard UX

- Making sure UX is simple and useful
- Making sure that you can go back after you reached a particular page
- If you don’t know much about UX, you should read this book - "Don't Make Me Think" - by Steve Krug

---

# Edge Cases

- If user does X, what happens to your application? Are there any unwanted consequences?
- You’ll surely discover new edge cases along the way. It’ll make you wonder how a user even did a certain action in the first place
- Mapping out edge cases will save you a lot of headaches in the future

# No passing tests === no deploys

- While you should have a decent amount of test coverage, your spec must be passing before it gets deployed.
- If you see that your tests are not passing while being ran in continuous integration tool, then the deploy should be stopped.

---

# Test the most crucial front-end features

- You should be making sure that your most crucial features are being tested, even on the front-end.
- Many times, you’ll hear that it works on my machine but then it doesn’t in other environments.
- Testing foundational interactions that your user will encounter is essential to building great software.

# Documentation

I’d like to know a few things:
- What does your project do?
- How can I get set up and start contributing?
- Is there any strange configuration that I need to know about?
- Is this project dependent on another project?

---

# Commit History

Sometimes projects can get a little unwieldy and we commit code with messages that are incoherent. We can fix this by doing a few things:
- Abiding by a git commit message template
- Sqashing old commits into something more readable
- Don’t be like these people: http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/

# Project Audit

For the next 30 minutes or so, you will get the opportunity to audit a peer's project. After, you will each share the feedback/findings with each other, then have time to make changes as needed.  

---

# Pick a Project

- Pick a project from your resume
- Send repo and resume to your partner
