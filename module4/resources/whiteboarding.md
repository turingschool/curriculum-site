# Whiteboarding Practice

## Warm Up
* Have you whiteboarded, either in a mock interview or real interview, yet?
* If so, how did that go? Why?
* How confident do you feel about whiteboarding?
* What advice have you heard - do’s and don’ts, etc.?

The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yYHc3Q_yEwy-9C-fs0gjaHAhrixGpCMFLJP8KX8ioq0/edit?usp=sharing) provide some talking points to help students understand the purpose of whiteboard sessions in interviews and some basic do's and don'ts.

## Presenting the Problems
Students should be in groups of 3-4, each group with a dedicated whiteboard. Assign an order that students will go in but do not tell them in advance.

Share the problem prompt, and give all students about 2 minutes to do their own prep and ask clarifying questions. Then announce whose turn it is for each group.

Each student should be given 5-7 minutes to whiteboard their challenge. During this time, other students in the group should be engaging as they would if they were interviewing someone. The point is NOT to trip someone up, but to gently support and push them. Th other students in the group should also be taking note of strengths of the student who is whiteboarding - both to provide as feedback and for them to consider when they whiteboard.
