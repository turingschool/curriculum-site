## Warmup

Answer the following questions:

1. What jobs have you used a worker for in the past?
2. How does a worker know to do its work?
3. What kind of jobs could your current project do in a worker?

## Messages, Queues, and Workers

Let's revisit the theory of workers, including:

* Removing "work" from the MVC request/response cycle
* Creating a queue
* Posting messages
* Creating a worker and listening for messages
* Doing the work
* Parallelism
* Posting results and other jobs
* Things that go wrong

## Paired Work

Now it's time for you to put these ideas into practice. Get together with a
pair and work through the [Small Background Jobs tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/performance/small_background_jobs.html).

## Wrapup

Let's spend our last five minutes checking-in on your progress and answering any questions.
