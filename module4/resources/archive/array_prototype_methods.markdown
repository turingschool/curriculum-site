## Structure

## Overview

In this session, we'll be looking at a collection of JS Array prototype functions
that deal with iterating and manipulating Arrays. The functions we'll examine are:

*   `forEach()`
*   `map()`
*   `filter()`
*   `reduce()`
*   `sort()`

The capabilities provided by these functions are somewhat analogous to the
capability provided by the `Enumerable` module in Ruby.

## Setup

For this lesson, we'll be walking through a tutorial from Mozilla's Advanced
JS Fundamentals series. As we go, you should follow along with the main outline [here](https://github.com/mdn/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/blob/gh-pages/tutorials/01-array-prototype-methods/README.md).

Additionally, we'll be working on a few exercises, which are included in the repository
under the `demos` directory.

Get set up with this by cloning the repository and changing to the appropriate directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/stevekinney/advanced-js-fundamentals-ck.git
cd advanced-js-fundamentals-ck/demos/array-prototype-methods/
```

During the tutorial, we'll periodically refer to the exercises contained in the various
subdirectories of this directory.
