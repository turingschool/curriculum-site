### Corrections & Improvements for Next Time

This is a beefy lesson covering numerous SQL and ActiveRecord techniques. We have recently been experimenting with giving it twice, once in module 3 and once in module 4, as the repetition seems to be helpful in absorbing the material. Additionally, it's good to follow this lesson shortly after with the [JS Blogger Performance Workshop](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/blogger_performance_workshop.markdown), which requires hands-on application of a number of the techniques in this lesson.
