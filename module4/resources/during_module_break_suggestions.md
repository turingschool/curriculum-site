# Break Expectations

Breaks during a module are a great opportunity to review topics covered up to this point, explore a new topic, or prep for the upcoming weeks. Over the break there is _not_ an expectation for you turn in any work. You know what is going to be most beneficial for you and how best to spend your time.

It is encouraged that you do some form of practice over the break, so that you when you come back it will not feel as difficult to get back in the groove. Below are some outlined suggestions. It is not recommended or necessary that you complete all of them.

### Problem Solving

These are some resources for challenges. Do time-box the amount of time you spend on a problem. It is recommended that you treat these as you might an interview challenge.
Think about what is your process"
Where do you start?
What do you do when you're not sure what comes next? What questions do you ask/google?
Even if you don't finish a challenge, focus on what went well and what might be holding you back?

Ruby or JavaScript
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)
- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/#explore-languages)
- [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase) _Note: these may be harder and take more time. Don't focus on completing the problem, but focusing on your process._


### JavaScript Focus

If you would like some more focus on JavaScript here are some ideas to help.

- Go back over the first project and either refactor code or start from scratch to re-create it.
- Videos to watch:
    - [Wes Bos JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP6CGK4YVJhL_VWetA865GOH)
    _Video 7, Video 14, and Video 18_ Feel free to explore the others, but they may focus on Frontend JavaScript

    - [Weird JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vfts4VzfNixzfaQWwDUg3W5TRbE7CyI)

### Explore

In a few weeks you will have your cross pollination project. If you are thinking about using a new language, not Rails or JavaScript, now is an opportunity to look into that language a little bit, so you have an idea of what you are getting yourself into. You can always visit one of the links in the problem solving section to see if they have the language you are interested in.

You may also try [Programming Koans](https://github.com/ts25504/awesome-koans) A programming Koan looks like a test where you will 'fill in the blank' with the right answer. It may help you get a look at the languages syntax and how the language behaves without having to build a new project for yourself.


#Conclusion

These are all different paths of opportunity and are suggestions for how you might spend a little of your time over break. Please __do__ spend time over the break in the way you need to and don't stress out about the above. These are only suggestions and the completion or non-completion __does not__ affect your promotion. Have a happy holiday!
