# Project Polish

Materials:
- Printouts of Audit Rubric (below) - 1 per student

This workshop gives students the opportunity to:
- Go in depth with another person's work - see what they like/would change
- Get feedback on a project from someone who (ideally) doesn't know the project as well, an outsider's perspective!
- Have dedicated class time to polish a resume project so they feel more confident presenting it to potential employers.

General flow of the workshop:
- Warm up question to get them thinking about what makes a person/dev portfolio "polished"
- 10-15 minutes discussing top considerations (slides are available)
- 5 minutes set up
  - It is really important that the students reviewing each others projects are not sitting together, talking or slacking, besides sharing the repo and deploy link. This allows for a more authentic audit and really helps students see the holes they need to fill. For that reason, I recommend assigned seating at the beginning, then pairs who are mid-across the room.
  - Pairs should slack repo and deploy link, give no other info.
  - Audit papers should be handed out.
- 30 minutes Audit  
  - Students should silently and independently complete the audit sheet for their partner. They should only complete the top portion.
- 10-15 minutes feedback
  - Set a 5 minute timer for one to share, stop, then the other.
- 1 hour+ Implement Feedback
- In Small Groups, give each person 2 minutes to share out on:
  - The feedback I got
  - The area I focused on
  - The steps I took, the outcome (show your group!)
  - The steps I plan to take in the future (and where they are documented)


### Audit Rubric

#### Git Workflow
- Are the commits following a consistent pattern?
- How were branches utilized?
- Was a PR template used?
- If a pair/group project, are code reviews/conversations present?

#### Testing
- Are you able to clone down the app and run tests?
- If so, do all tests pass?
- Is there documentation on how to show coverage?
- If so, is coverage > 99%?

#### Deployed Application
- Do you know how to use the application?
- Is navigation clear and easy?
- Try to poke holes in the app - Did you get any errors? Should you have gotten any errors?
- Run an accessibility audit (in DevTools, either use the aXe tool or under the Audits tab). Any issues with accessibility?
- Were you confused about what the app did, how to use it, or anything, at **any** time? Please be as specific as possible, and provide solutions if you have any!

#### Documentation / Resume
- Does the resume highlight things that set this developer apart from other applicants for a Junior Developer position?
- Is wording in resume and README consistent?
- README (lower priority for today - we will have a more in-depth workshop on READMEs later in the mod!)
  - Is there an explanation of the purpose of the app/problem it is solving?
  - Are there screenshots?
  - Are there crystal-clear instructions on how to get the project up and running on your machine?
  - Is there detailed info on endpoints (verb, human readable explanation of the data, endpoint, response (body and codes), expected request if applicable, errors that will come back and why)?
  - Is this dependent on any other project? Is that project linked?


# STOP! The following section should be completed by the author of the project that was being audited.


### Feedback Synthesis (to be completed by author of project)
- What are 2-3 main takeaways from this feedback?



- What feels most urgent to you?



- What feels highest leverage?



- What are you going to start on today (~1 hour of work time)?



- What other pieces would you like to continue polishing?
