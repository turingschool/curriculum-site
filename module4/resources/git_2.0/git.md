### Goals

- Familiarize students with other Git commands that they can use in their Git workflow
- Introduce Git rebase

### Kicking Off the Lesson

- Lesson should take 1.5 - 2 hours
- 10 minutes to go over learning goals, structure of the lesson, and divide into groups
- 25 minutes for everyone's first station to allow for them to get setup
- 40 minutes total for the remaining stations (20 minutes per station)
- Leave post-its on the table for students to write questions on and collect between each station change (if possible)
- Give pom after all stations have been completed
- Whole Group Review:
  - Begin with a Turn and Talk: What is one command you will incorporate in your workflow and why?
  - Review Git rebase workflow and have students talk about what they learned during their research
  - Answer post-it questions, if they haven't been answered already and any remaining student questions
