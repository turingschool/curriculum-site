## Retro
It is valuable for you and your team to dedicate time __during__ and __after__ a project to have a retro. During this time, you should reflect on the project, communication, and teamwork that has occurred thus far. Use this reflection to inform how your next sprint can continue doing what is well and improve from what you've learned. Create a gist and use the questions below to guide your retro.

### Guiding Questions

* What did we do well, that we want to continue?
    * Why do we think it is important?


* What did we learn?


* What should we do differently next time?
  * Why do we think we should do it differently and do we have a plan we want to try?


* What still puzzles us?
