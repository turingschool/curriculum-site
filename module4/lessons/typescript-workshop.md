## TypeScript Workshop

You will spend this time applying your knowledge of TypeScript to build a simple React app with TypeScript.

**1.** You should begin by creating a new React app with TypeScript by following the steps outlined in the [Vite docs](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

**2.** Once you've got your React with TypeScript app created, start building! You have choices here:
- Recreate the IdeaBox from last inning by following [this guide](https://curriculum.turing.edu/module3/lessons/react_ideabox). This guide is for building an ideabox using React and JavaScript, not TypeScript.  As you go, let the TypeScript errors guide you to make the necessary adjustments to your code.
- Build anything you like. Get creative! Try to keep the scope super small - remember, you only have a few hours to work on this!

You can and should be collaborative during this time. Jump into study hall, ask questions in your code-help channel, use the internet, etc. This is meant to be time to practice your TS fundamentals - don't get disctracted by other things (like CSS). 

**Have fun!**
