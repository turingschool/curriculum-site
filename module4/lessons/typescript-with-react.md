## TypeScript Workshop

First let's see some more TS without React involved. Just like we learned JS without React, it's nice to learn TS without React so we can separate what is TS syntax and what is React syntax.

### Explore

Open up this [repl.it](https://replit.com/@robbiejaeger/TypeScriptIntro#index.ts), and let's explore TS more.

## TypeScript with React

In this section, we'll work on a very small TS React app that has some functionality already built and add to it. It's a trivia app that uses the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for the dataset.

### More Exploration!

Open up this [Trivia Repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/trivia-typescript), set it up, and explore some TS within React.

If you're creating a TS React app from scratch, [this doc page](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) on starting TS with Create React App is very useful. It's more difficult to add in TS after the fact than to start fresh with TS from the start, but it can be done, of course.

## Next Steps and Resources

Continue learning TypeScript:
* Convert an old React project to TypeScript
* Create a new app from scratch that you're passionate about
* Look at open-source applications using TypeScript to see common patterns

Practice interview questions:
* What is TypeScript, and how does it differ from JavaScript?
* Why would a development team want to use TypeScript?
* What does it mean for TS to infer a type?
* How would you handle defining your own object shapes in TypeScript?
* Describe the use of "generics" in TypeScript and provide an example.
* What is the "any" type in TS, and should you use it?

(ChatGPT is a great resource for obtaining possible interview questions.)

Other resources:
* [TS Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [TS Quick References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets)
* There are tons of "Intro to TS" videos out there on YouTube
