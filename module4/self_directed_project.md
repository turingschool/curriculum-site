## Project Description

You've made it to the final stretch of the Turing experience, and you are ready to build a sweet application that shows off all that you've learned. The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

The project requirements are listed below:

* [Learning Goals](#learning-goals)
* [Technical Expectations](#technical-expectations)
* [Project Concepts](#project-concepts)
* [Check-ins](#check-ins-and-milestones)
* [Evaluation](#evaluation)

## <a name="learning-goals"></a> Learning Goals

* Learning how to build a full Rails app from idea to delivery
* Revisiting previous concepts such as APIs and OAuth
* Finding the strengths and gaps in your knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and organizing
a project.

## <a name="technical-expectations"> Technical Expectations

Every project will be a bit different, but they need to share some
common technical characteristics:

* You must use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
* You must consume an external API
* You must implement a production quality user interface
* You must optimize your application optimizing your database, implementing caching, using background workers, and sending AJAX requests

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on  every checkin
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### APIs

Your application **must make good use of one external dataset or API**. Some examples include:

#### Government Data

* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
* [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/)
* [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/tools/)
* [NASA](http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/)
* [US Census](http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)
* [Socrata Listings](https://opendata.socrata.com/dataset/Socrata-Customer-Spotlights/6wk3-4ija)
* [Bureau of Labor & Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/developers/api_ruby.htm)
* [United Nations](https://www.undata-api.org/) (3rd party API)
* [Google's Directory of Public Data](http://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
* [OpenColorado](http://data.opencolorado.org/)
* [Denver Regional Council of Governments](https://drcog.org/services-and-resources/data-maps-and-modeling)

#### Corporate Data

* [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com)
* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com)
* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/developer)
* [Github](https://developer.github.com/v3)
* [FitBit](https://dev.fitbit.com)
* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api)
* [Strava](https://www.strava.com/developers)
* [Uber](https://developer.uber.com)
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps)

However, the list is not limited to these. You can choose to integrate with a service of your choosing, as long as it is approved by your client.

## <a name="project-concepts"></a> Project Concepts

A week prior to the Self-Directed Project kickoff, each cohort member needs to generate at least **three project ideas**. The ideas must solve a real problem. To put your ideas into project proposals follow the template below. Each idea should have one project proposal.

Once the project proposals are in place, each cohort member will pick an idea, and put the remaining two ideas into the shared ideas. The entire cohort will then vote on the ideas it wants to see built. Finally, the cohort members will have an opportunity to exchange their idea for one of the shared ones, or keep their original idea.

### Project Template

```markdown
### [Project Title]

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
```

## Check-ins and Milestones

You will meet with instructors periodically during the project. The goals of each check-in roughly what should be completed before the check-in is listed below.

### 1st Check-in

- 15-25 minutes

#### What should be done

What you build is pretty much up to you. Instructors will want to go over your plan for the project. Research the APIs you want to use, and have a vision for what you want to build. It's better to know the limits API you're using than to be deep into code at this point. If you've only used Postman to this point, that's just fine.

#### What to expect from instructors

Instructors will help you refine your plan, including scope, wireframes and project management. You'll also decide what should be done by the next check-in.

Don't expect to go over too much code, but if you've got technical questions, go ahead and bring them up.


### 2nd Check-in

- 15-25 minutes

#### What should be done

This is based on what you decided in your last check-in. If you've changed the plan, be sure to let your instructor know prior to the check-in. Have a plan for what you'd like to go over. Specific technical questions, discussing strategies for execution, or whatever else you'd like to talk about.

#### What to expect from instructors

Instructors will review the work you've done so far at a high level. What's working? What are you in the middle of? Then it's really up to you what to look at, whether it's with your client or technical lead.

You'll also decide what should be done by the next check-in.

### 3rd Check-in

- 15-25 minutes

#### What should be done

This is based on what you decided in your last check-in. If you've changed the plan, be sure to let your instructor know prior to the check-in. Have a plan for what you'd like to go over. Specific technical questions, discussing strategies for execution, or whatever else you'd like to talk about.

Last check-in before evaluation. Make sure you've reviewed the evaluation criteria, and bring any questions you have about it.

#### What to expect from instructors

Instructors will review the work you've done so far at a high level. They may have some comments on bugs to fix or extensions to build. Then it's really up to you what to look at.
