# Whiteboard

## Objectives 
-   To have a clear strategy to tackle whiteboard problems
-   Understand what employers are looking for

* Overview
  * Summary
  * Types of interview problems
  * What is an interviewer looking for
  * Have Mike(or a student) answer a question on the whiteboard
  * Step by step strategy
  * Have students do a problem on pen an paper

### Summary(1-3 minutes)
  * Whiteboarding is not fair! 
  * Most places that interview have a live coding or whiteboard portion of the
    interview.
  * 30 minutes to an hour in length.
  * Should be solvable in that length of time.
  * They let you use any language that you want

### Common interview problems(1-3 minutes)
  * Questions will often be brain teasers.
  * Examples
    * Find out if a word is a palindrome
    * Fibonacci sequence using recursion
    * Given an array of numbers, find the greatest product between two numbers
    * Anything you can find on Exercism.io

### Things interviewer is looking for(3-7 minutes)
  * Are they asking the right questions?
  * How are their problem solving skills?
  * Does the solution work?
  * Does the code compile?
    * You should be practicing on a whiteboard as much as possible, if not pen
      and paper.
    * Do the entire problem then type it in and see if it compiles
  * Does the solution read well?(Examples)
  * Performance(Big O Notation, Greedy solutions, time and space complexity)

### Mike does an example whiteboard(20-35 minutes in length)
  * Given an array of numbers, can you give me back only the unique numbers?
    Feel free to use any language you want.
  * As he is doing the problem, I want everyone to write down one good thing
    they notice Mike doing and something he can improve on as well.
  * Ask people for feedback, list pros and cons on whiteboard

### Step by step strategy(12-18 minutes)
  - What are the inputs and the return value?
  - Edge cases
  - Start writing code(Verbalize and "teach")
  - Working solution first
  - Prove that it works, use some sample test data.(If you didn't cover edge
cases now you time is to make it up)
      * Iteration chart
  - Refactor
    * Pull out smaller pieces of functionality into their own functions
    * Performance

### Students practice and review 45mins - 1hr and 15mins
  * Do the problem on pen and paper
    * Given a collection, find the max, min, and length of the collection. 
    * Have students discuss steps one and two in pairs, get together and discuss.
    * Have them do steps 4-6 on their own.

## Wrap up
  * Memorize and implement this strategy
  * How many of you have any interview lined up?
    * Should practice one of these a day
    * By practice I mean complete the problem no matter how long it takes
