title: Module 4 - Intermission Pre-Work
---

## Overview

This prework should take no longer than 20 hours to complete the Deliverables. Intermission is absolutely your time to rest and focus on self care. Plan accordingly with your schedules so you don't add unnecessary stress.

### Demo Competition

If you are planning to demo a project at Demo Comp in week 1 of Mod 4, you MUST timebox your time over intermission and in weeks 1 and 2 to ensure you are meeting module expectations. We recommend setting aside specific times to work with your demo team over intermission to finish your demo BEFORE week 1 begins. You are responsible for balancing your time between working on the demo project and the tasks below.
