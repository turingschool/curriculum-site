### Demo Showcase Prep Guidelines

All incoming Mod 4 students are required to demo their Mod 3 consultancy projects at the Demo Showcase on Wednesday of Week 1.

Presentations should be 8-10 minutes long and include the following:
- Introduce your team and your project
- Why did you create this product, what makes it interesting (you are telling a story here)
- Demo your project
- Add an architecture diagram rather than logo list of tech stack
- This should be a technically grounded presentation, this means you should answer at least one question from each of the following sections:
  - Questions about continuing to work on the project:
    - As you think about scaling your application to accommodate more users and data, what specific features would you add in order to improve the usability of the app?
    - How would your architecture need to change in order to scale your application to accommodate more users and data?
    - If you were to continue working on this project, what additional features would you add to help create the best possible user experience?
    - What are some ways that you can make your application more accessible?
  - Questions about tech stack:
    - What about the framework(s) you chose made it/them the right choice for the application you wanted to build?
    - Looking back on your choice of technologies, is there anything that you now believe to be limiting the direction you could take the application in? Why or why not?
  - Questions about process:
    - Other than learning a new language/framework, what was the most significant or interesting technical challenge your team encountered and how did you work together to resolve it?
    - What specific processes did you follow in order to better prepare yourselves to be members of software development organizations?
    - What type of technical documentation did you create? How did this help streamline communication on your team?
    - What were your most effective meetings/methods of communication with your team and what made them effective?

**We recommend setting aside specific times to work with your demo team over intermission to finish your demo prep BEFORE week 1 begins. You are responsible for balancing your time between working on the demo project and the tasks below.**

## Non-Deliverable but Helpful

1. Refamiliarize yourself with the basics of [reading and evaluating technical documentation](./reading_documentation)

2. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eesqK59rhGA) about the HTTP request-response cycle. 

4. Review [this lesson](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module_four/negotiations) on salary negotiations.

5. Try to complete 2-3 technical challenges in your preferred language. Focus on your approach to breaking down the problem, and be sure to timebox yourself. After the timebox, look at a solution or two to see different approaches!
