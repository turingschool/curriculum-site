# Musixmatch Challenge

For this take home challenge, you have the opportunity to be creative and challenge yourself to show off your skills. This challenge should be time boxed to two days, so keep that in mind as you are looking over your options. You will need to DM your instructors which challenge that you are choosing by Friday week 5 by 5pm. Once you have made your decision, you are committed to the guidelines of that challenge. Take time to read over both options and think carefully on which one _you_ want to pursue.

## Challenge 1

Decide what programming language you would like to use to create and test your API.

Use the [musicxmatch api](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) to interact with, and design your own API with 5 endpoints(familiar programming language) or 3 endpoints(new programming language). These endpoints should be tested.

**This application should not include authentication. You will not need users login or sign-up endpoints.**
If you do complete everything and have time for an extension, then you can implement authentication.

Create a service or background worker that will randomly pick a 'song of the day' and send it in an email **or** text notification.

Your application should be deployed to production.

## Challenge 2

Decide what programming language you would like to use to create and test your API.

Use the [musicxmatch api](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) to interact with, and design your own API with 5 endpoints(familiar programming language) or 3 endpoints(new programming language). These endpoints should be tested.

**This application should not include authentication. You will not need users login or sign-up endpoints.**
If you do complete everything and have time for an extension, then you can implement authentication.

Create a separate single page, frontend application that will interact with your API. The frontend application can be written using jQuery and vanilla JavaScript. _It is not necessary for you to use a frontend framework._ This single page application should have some styling and should update the information on the page without needing to refresh the entire page. 

Both your backend and frontend application should be deployed to production.
