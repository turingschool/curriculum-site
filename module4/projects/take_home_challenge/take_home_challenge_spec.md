# Take Home Challenge

For your Week 6 solo project, you will complete, submit, and defend a 'take home challenge' as you would in an interview processes. Your evaluation will take into account your quality of work (code and design and thought behind it), and your ability to present and communicate your process/rationale for decisions, code, challenges, and wins.

## Your challenge

Your challenge will be presented in class by your instructors.

You are welcome to send a DM with a couple of clarifying questions, but keep in mind that you are treating this like an actual interview process -- the questions should be as clearly and professionally asked as you would in an email, as well as your responses to whatever answer you get. It probably wouldn't be ideal that you attempt to have several back-and-forths with a potential employer. Part of what they are looking for in you, especially as an entry-level dev, is how much initiative you can take without hand-holding.

On the flip-side, not having enough clarification like you commonly do on curriculum projects may raise concern for you about 'passing' the project.

We have provided a rubric so you know how you will be evaluated, and you know the general expectations at Turing. We are looking for your best work and presentation of yourself and your work. _Build something you are proud of and you will pass._

## Timeline

The challenge will be due by 8am on Wednesday of Week 6. One of your instructors will meet with you Wednesday morning for you to present what you've built.

Treat the presentation time as you would to a prospective employer in a final interview. The rubric will detail things, but your presentation should be a minimum of 10 minutes long, be driven by you not prompts from your instructor, and can include both live coding and/or slides.

The presentation should include what the project was about and why you designed your solution the way that you did, your learning goals, tech stack, what you enjoyed most about the project, something you struggled with and overcame, etc..

## Submission

Please DM both instructors the repo and production deployment URLs. This message should be received no later than 8am on Wednesday of Week 6.
