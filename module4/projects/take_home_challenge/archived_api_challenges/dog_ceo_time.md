## DogCEOTime
Use this API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to build an app that...
• Option 1: Setup Auth somehow so that step 3 can be saved for each user. A user should get some (you choose how many) photos of dogs, and should have the option to "like" them. A user can see all photos they've liked, and unlike if they change their mind.
• Option 2: No auth; anyone who goes to the site sees the same thing. Visitors can rate dog photos cuteness 11/10, 12/10, 13/10 or higher! They can then filter dog photos by cuteness level.
