## MoveTime
Create a tool that people who are considering moving can get some data points on for a prospective city:
- What is the cost of living?
- What is the population?
At least 2 more considerations, from the following or based on your own ideas:
- What is the walkability score? Bike-ability score?
- Proximity to airport
- Cost of vehicle registration
- Cost of gas
Users should be able to "favorite" and "eliminate" cities, and see their master list of favorites. If they re-search for an eliminated city, they should still be able to access the data but should receive a friendly reminder that they eliminated it.
Consider how you will make sure all of the numbers are put into perspective for your user, so that they all have meaning.
