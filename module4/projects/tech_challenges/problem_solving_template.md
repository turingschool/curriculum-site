Sometimes the hardest part of a challenge is undestanding what you are trying to solve, or knowing where to begin. Below is a guide to help you get started and gain momementum for developing a solution. Use a notebook, gist, or document to copy the prompts below and work through them.

1. Rewrite the question in your own words
2. Answer these questions:
    - What assumptions will you make about this problem if you cannot ask any more clarifying questions? 
    - What are your reasons for making those assumptions?
    - What are your initial thoughts about this problem? (high level design, 2-3 sentences)
3. Identify the elements of this problem
    - [ ] Searching of Data
    - [ ] Sorting of Data
    - [ ] Pattern Recognition
    - [ ] Build/Navigate a Grid
    - [ ] Math
    - [ ] Language API knowledge
    - [ ] Optimization
4. Consider which data structure(s) do you think you'll use? What pros/cons do you see with that choice?
5. Write out a few lines of initial pseudocode: (mid-level design, NOT REAL CODE)
6. Write your implementation code and test your solution (low-level design)

Reminders
1. It is okay to use Google! However, you should __not__ google the technical challenge to find solutions unless you have completed the challenge yourself. __Do__ use Google or documentation to look up possible enumerables that might be a part of your solution, check assumptions about your pseudo code, or for clarifying parts of the problem.

2. Please do not make your answers public.
