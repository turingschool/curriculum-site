## Objective
The overall objective of the Capstone Project is to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills you've learned in this program to solve technical problems in the context of a real project and following professional software development practices.

## Learning Goals
* Strengthen your ability to apply the skills you've learned in this program to solve technical problems
* Work in a full stack, agile, production or production-like environment
* Research and implement solutions that you have not been explicitly taught
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow

## Overview
The Capstone Project is an opportunity to practice working like a developer in a professional environment. You will work under the guidance of your instructor to complete work on a real project in use by the Turing Community. On occassion, we will start a brand new project that is not yet in use, but with the intention of launching it to the Turing Community after MVP is reached. Like a professional developer, you will be expected to research and implement solutions that you have not been explicitly taught. Your project manager will be responsible for assigning tasks and guiding the team. You, the developer, will be responsible for technical decisions, breaking features into smaller tasks, and implementation.
