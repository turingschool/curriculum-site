## Overview

You will notice that much of the rubric assesses:
* Your regular, continual, and active participation in the project
* Your ability to collaborate with your team
* Your ability to implement features and solve problems while adhering to the project's conventions

As such, you will be assessed throughout the duration of the project rather that during one final evaluation session at the end. Just like on the job, you are expected to perform at a high level consistently and not just on the days when you are undergoing review.

## Self Assessment

Self assessment is a required part of the project. Failure to submit the self-assessment will result in a failure for the project. It is an opportunity for you to reflect on your work, identify areas for improvement, share your successes, and celebrate your accomplishments. Self evaluation is also common in professional environments. Typically this happens during your annual review (or whatever cadence your company uses). 

You should include the following in your self assessment:
* Share feedback you have received from at least two teammates
  * You can copy and paste feedback from Slack if written or summarize if verbal
* List your contributions to the project
  * Can be submitted as issues you completed or as a list of tasks/features you implemented
* What technical areas do you feel strongest in?
  * _Examples: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Testing, Debugging, Deployment, Project Management, Collaboration, Git Workflow, etc_
* Discuss 2-3 areas of improvement for yourself as a developer and team member
* Assign yourself a score in each category

## Rubric
<section class="note">
Students are expected to score in the **Meets Expectations** category. If any one category score is **Below Expectations** _OR_ two or more categories are **Approaching Expectations**, the project will be considered failing.

- **Below Expectations:**
  * Updates project board less than once per day
  * Provides constructive and actionable feedback on 1 or fewer pull requests
  * Behaving in an anti-collaborative way. This might look like:
    * Not contributing to project planning or decision making discussions
    * Disappearing for 24 hours or more (Monday-Friday) without notice or explanation
    * Not following the project's defined workflow
    * Missing deadlines, meetings, or discussions without notice more than once

### Code Quality
- **Exceeds Expectations:**
  * Proactively seeks to understand and improve code performance by asking questions and researching solutions
  * Shows a keen interest in learning about tools and architecture solutions outside of the scope of lessons taught at Turing
  * Actively participates in reviews of their own code and addresses feedback effectively
  * 100% of code is well tested, including sad paths and edge cases
- **Meets Expectations:**
  * Demonstrates strong understanding of the primary programming language and framework used in the project through implementation and successful completion of all issues assigned
  * Effectively addresses feedback from code reviews
  * At least 90% of code is well tested, including sad paths and edge cases
  * Implements proper error handling
  * Demonstrates understanding of code organization principles (e.g., separation of concerns, SRP, DRY)
  * Maintains a clean and organized codebase, following agreed-upon coding standards
- **Approaching Expectations:**
  * Usually demonstrates a strong understanding of the primary programming language and framework used in the project though occassionally strays from conventions or the project's coding standards
  * Usually addresses feedback from code reviews but occassionally misses details
  * Improperly handles some errors
  * Most code is well tested but some edge cases or sad paths are not tested
- **Below Expectations:**
  * Does not demonstrate a strong understanding of the primary programming language and framework used in the project either through incorrect implementation or lack of completion of issues assigned
  * Does not follow the project's coding standards
  * More often than not, does not implement error handling
  * Code is not well tested missing many edge cases and sad paths
