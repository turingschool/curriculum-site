## Being Visible
  - List 3 conferences you would be interested in attending or speaking at
    - For each conference:
      - When is their next CFP deadline
      - Do they have any scholarships you could apply to?
      - Come up with 3 talk ideas and list below

  - List 3 Meetup groups in the area you plan to move to
    - For each meetup:
      - List the sponsors if they share any
      - Link to an upcoming Meetup you'd be interested in attending
      - List any organizers that you know or recognize
      - Come up with 3 ways you could be more involved e.g. TAing a GirlDevelopIt class, teaching a Beginner's Track, giving a talk on a topic

  - Do you have a blog? (If not, create one - I suggest medium.com)
    - Come up with 3 blog post ideas

  - For the area you plan to move, are there any developer community Slack channels? If so, how can you join them?

## Staying Involved
  - How do you plan to stay involved with Turing after graduation?
    - Do you plan on mentoring, if so have you contacted Mary?
  - Do you plan to stay in touch with any of your mentors?
  - How do you plan/hope to stay in touch with your cohort?

## Summary
  - Define 3 goals for community involvement over the next six months
  - For each goals, list some steps to take over the next six months.

Spend some time over the next few days building up your community involvement. Clean up your blog, write some conference talk proposals, reach out and schedule coffee dates, join some slack channels and pair with other students at Turing. Feel free to talk about your experiences below:
