title: Goals
---

Whether you're going right into a job, still job hunting, or repeating module 4 - you should work to identify goals for how you want to continue growing technically as a developer.

This could be something like 'learn GoLang', 'contribute to open source', 'improve my JavaScript abilities', 'build a weird thing'

At the end of module 3, you became a 'real developer' - so when you think about how to achieve these goals you should be thinking of them like a developer would. For example, if you walk in to an interview and say you know Go, that means you've built something in Go, not that you've taken a codeschool AND codacademy course in Go and followed along with a TODO app tutorial.

Focus on real ways you can demonstrate your learning and motivate yourself to keep at it.

To get started, here are 2 goals you will want to schedule for the next 6 weeks:


1. #### Informational Interviews

      Now that you're 'on your own', you'll want to start networking in a low-stress, low pressure sorta way. Informational interviews are a good way to do this. We covered this stuff in our PD sessions. You are required to get 3 informational interviews by the end of your first 7 weeks off.

      If it were me I would assign myself due dates like:

      End of week 2 - one informational interview
      End of week 3 - two additional informational interviews
      End of week 4 - three additional informational interviews

      That way you can have a little leeway should you not get an interview one week. These interviews should not be terribly hard to get since they are only informational.

1. #### Blog Post

      Keep fresh on things and keep your voice active in the community. This blogpost will be either the open-source contribution post, or a technical post (whichever you did not do for the portfolio in mod4).


### Next, Identify Personal Goals:

List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the next year.


### Define

For each goal:
  - State where you are currently at with this goal
    - e.g. 'I have given a lightning talk on Go', 'I downloaded EMACS', 'I am at an intermediate level with JavaScript'
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Outline resources for learning
    - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
        - List meetups and conferences related to this goal (if relevant)
    - List ideas or links to things you could or are currently building to achieve this goal. (check out the side-hustle assignment)
    - List ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that you could give on this topic. (check out the community involvement assignment)
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal (check out the open source assignment)
  - Why is this goal important to you?
