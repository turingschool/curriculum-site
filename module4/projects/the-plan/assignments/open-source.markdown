### Reading Assignment

- Read [Contributing to Open Source](https://gist.github.com/rrgayhart/72e5c2e4e0f0f50247bb)

### Brainstorm and list some goals for open source work
  - My motivation for contributing to open source is:
    - e.g. 'I want to learn production-level Ruby', 'I want to help a non-profit that I believe in like the Peace Corps', 'I want DHH to notice me' etc
  - I would like to work with the following tech:
    - e.g. 'I want to work in Ruby because I'm comfortable in it', 'I want to try and work on an electron project'

### Find 5 Open Source Projects that Fit Your Goals Above
  List each project with a link to the repo

  Resources:
    - https://github.com/explore
    - http://24pullrequests.com
    - Turing Mentors - many of them maintain or contribute to open source
    - Turing has some open source projects, like `LookingFor`, for example...
    - Look up the github pages for jobs you plan to apply to
    - Think about gems or npm libraries that you use often

### Per Project, answer the following questions:
  - Is this library well maintained?
   - Look at things like the last merged commit, the number of open pull requests that haven't been merged... etc.
 - Does this library look easy to get running locally?
   - Do they have instructions in the README to contribute or run locally?
 - Where would I get started finding something to work on?
   - Are there open issues that haven't been claimed?
   - Is it clear who the maintainer is, so that I can contact them?
   - If I'm familiar with the library, is there anything I wish was included in the documentation that I could add?
   - Does the library have some form of Code Coverage or are there some edge cases that might not be tested that I could add testing for?

### Get Up and Running

 Once you have profiled 5 libraries, pick 2 or 3 that seem friendly, fork them, clone them down locally and _try_ to get them running.

Per Forked Application:
  - Did you get the application running locally?
    - If not, where did you stop in the process and why?
    - If yes, did you find anything you needed to do to run the app locally that wasn't in the README/instructions? Do you think you can put in a PR to add that?

### Next Steps

Spend some time over the next few days working on understanding and contributing to one of the open source libraries you profiled above. Try to dig into the codebase and understand small pieces. Compare the way the library tests to testing styles you've seen before. Try and work on small fixes or features.
