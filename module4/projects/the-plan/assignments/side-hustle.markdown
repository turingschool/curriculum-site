Making a thing is a super power that you now have. It helps you stand out among your fellow developers. It helps you hone your skills with good motivation. It could even save the world, help a community, make you some cash or just make one person's day a little weirder.

Whether you build something to help people or just to amuse yourself, the value of building something of your own is enormous!

### Reading Assignment

- Read [6 Tricks for Successful Side Projects](https://quickleft.com/blog/6-tricks-for-successful-side-projects/)

- Brainstorm 3 ideas for side projects and/or existing side projects you're working on

- For each side project:
  - What is my 'MVP' for this project? e.g. what is the smallest amount of work I can do on this project to consider it something I can release to the world.
  - Outline future iterations for this project
  - Why do I want to build this side project?
  - How do I plan to stay on track with completing or working on this project?
  - Is there anyone I would want to get involved in working on or code reviewing this project?
  - How would I get this side project out into the world? Tweet about it? Submit it to ProductHunt?
