[Back to Employer Case Study Overview](./index.html)


## Purpose

Your presentation will not only showcase your research and networking efforts but also provide insights into your adaptability and problem-solving skills. It's an opportunity to reflect on your experiences and demonstrate how you've grown and learned throughout the process.

## Structure

- Student-directed presentation (~10-15 minutes)
    * Develop an organized slide deck or Google document to present your research and job search steps.
    * Include visual aids, such as charts or graphs, to enhance your presentation.
- Instructor feedback (~5 minutes)

## Potential Outcomes

- If everything goes according to plan: good luck in the future!
- If a student fails to present (due to illness, etc), please arrange an alternate time to present to instructors.
- If a student delivers an exceptionally poor presentation: instructors will determine the next steps.
