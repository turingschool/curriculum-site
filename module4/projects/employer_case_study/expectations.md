[Back to Employer Case Study Overview](./index.html)


## Part 1: Find the Opportunity and Research the Role and Company
<section class="dropdown">
### Finding the target role
- Students identify a  job opportunity that aligns with their career goals and interests.
- Search for roles on job boards, company websites, and through networking.
- Consider first narrowing your search to a few specific companies that you are interested in. It can be helpful to target based on things like:
  * **Company location** - physical proximity opens you up to hybrid and in-person roles, which often have fewer applicants
  * **Previous industry** - Example: if you have a background in education, you may want to consider companies in the edutech space
  * **Non-tech companies** that use technology to solve a problem - Example: a port-a-potty company likely uses software to manage their operations and schedules. No for real. We have an alum who got this job.

### Answering the "Three Whys"
 You will research the company of your chosen job opportunity from Part 1. You will articulate your genuine interest in the company ("Why this Company?"), understand the company's needs for the specific role ("Why this Role?"), and demonstrate why you are the right fit for the position ("Why You?"). 

#### First Why: Why this Company?
- Demonstrate a genuine interest in the organization.
- Research and provide insights into the company's business model or competitive advantage that sets it apart in its industry.
- Explore the company's tech stack, addressing its technological aspects.
- Investigate the cultural fit by describing the company's impact and mission.

#### Second Why: Why this Role? 
- Understanding Hiring Manager Needs
- Apply from the hiring manager's viewpoint, explaining why the role is crucial for the company.
- Perform a [SWOT analysis](./swot_analysis.html) of the role, considering its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

</section>

### Part 1 Deliverables
1. **A copy of the job description:** The job description should be copied into a google doc. If the original job posting is removed, you will have no way of finding it again which is why we require this method.
2. SWOT analysis
3. Answers to the "Three Whys"
4. Resume tailored to the role and company
  * A strong resume will identify and extract relevant keywords, qualifications, responsibilities, and industry-specific details from the job description and use these extracted details to tailor the resume, ensuring it highlights your skills and experiences that match the requirements of the role.
5. Cover letter tailored to the role and company
  * A strong cover letter will include your answers to the the "why" questions above.

**Use [this form](https://forms.gle/fMMj4bhJoNqn7NLY7) to submit your deliverables at least 24 hours before your interview. Please ensure the links you submit are accessible to your instructor.**

## Part 2: The Job Application
The next step of the employer case study is to apply to your chosen job opportunity. 

<section class="note">
**IMPORTANT:** You do NOT need to wait until after your interview simulation to complete these steps or apply to the job. If you'd like feedback on your materials sooner than the interview simulation, you can schedule a check-in with your instructor.
</section>

### Application Process
<section class="dropdown">
### 1. Outreach to Someone at the Company
- Draft effective outreach messages, which could be emails, LinkedIn messages, or other suitable platforms.
- Apply strategies to capture the recipient's attention, showcase their genuine interest in the company, and encourage a positive response.
</section>

<section class="dropdown">
### 2. Prepare for the Meeting
- If the outreach leads to a response and a meeting is scheduled, prepare for it by doing things like:
  * Developing a list of questions and topics to discuss
  * Researching the person you'll meet with
  * Considering your own value proposition.
</section>

<section class="dropdown">
### 3. Complete Application
- After networking and meeting with someone from the company, complete the job application process. You can further tailor your resume and cover letter to reflect the insights gained during your research and discussions.
  - **NOTE:** If you were unable to connect with someone at the company, you should still tailor your resume and cover letter with the details you learned during the Employer Persona Research Phase.
- Follow through with the application, considering any additional materials or follow-up steps as needed.
</section>

This comprehensive job search process allows you to take the knowledge and skills you've acquired through the employer persona research and apply them to real-world job applications. It ensures that you approach their job search strategically and professionally, increasing your chances of success in securing roles that align with your career goals and values.

### Part 2 Deliverables
<!-- NOTE: Or would we rather receive this via a form some other time? Previously this was discussed as a part of the final presentation. -->
1. Create a document outlining your application process, network efforts, and the outcomes for each step and submit it to your instructor during your interview simulation time. The document should include the following:

        * Describe your interactions and connections within the organization.

        * Address any research conducted on the individuals you interacted with.
        * Even if a meeting hasn't yet occurred, you should still have some notes prepped so you're ready to go if/when someone gets back to you.
  * Interview Simulation Preparation
        * Discuss steps you took to prepare for your interview simulation as a result of your research and networking.
  * Outcome and Reflection:

## Part 3: Interview Simulation
The primary goal of the interview simulation, based on your selected job description, is to provide you with realistic and practical experience of a job interview process. Before your interview, you should create an interview preparation document. Some ideas of what to include:
  * A list of common interview questions and space for your answers with a focus on the tech stack listed in your chosen role.
  * A section for questions you intend to ask during the interview. Research the company and the role to formulate insightful questions that demonstrate your genuine interest.
  * Use this document to practice your responses, ensuring you are well-prepared for the interview and able to showcase your qualifications effectively.
  * Take a look at the resources below to use or get ideas for creating your own prep document.
