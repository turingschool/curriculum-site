## Learning Goals
1. Research Skills: Students will learn how to gather comprehensive information about a chosen company, including its history, culture, mission, and values.

2. Alignment with Personal Goals: Students will gain insights into how to assess the alignment between their personal career goals and values with those of a chosen company. Students will be able to clearly articulate why a chosen company stands out to them and what it represents, as well as define the role title they are targeting within that company.

3. Prepare for Real Interviews: Equip students with the ability to navigate the job market effectively, with a focus on matching their skills and interests to actual job openings. This, in turn, will enhance their chances of securing job opportunities that align with their career goals.

4. Enhance Interview Skills: Help students develop and refine their interview skills, including answering questions, presenting their qualifications, and showcasing their suitability for the role.

5. Communication and Networking: Students will develop skills in obtaining contact information and initiating conversations or networking with representatives from the chosen company.

## Overview
The employer case study is a comprehensive project where students create a detailed profile for a company they would like to pursue in their job search, including key information about the company's technology stack, features, and business model. They will evaluate the company's strengths, culture, and strategic direction, while also formulating critical questions that are vital to ask during the job application and interview process. 
 
This project will equip students with a strong job hunt framework to effectively communicate their value to potential employers.
