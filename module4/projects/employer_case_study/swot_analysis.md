## ADDRESSING PERCEIVED WEAKNESSES AND GAPS

Know your Differentiators. Some examples might be that you:
  - Are multilingual
  - Have a rare combination of industry skills (MBA and Lawyer)
  - Have a special talent that is relevant to your field such as a published author.
  - Completed an expat assignment or have extensive global or “in-country” experience

Show the following:
  - Be honest about your background
  - Show that you understand why the skill is important to the role
  - Illustrate how you’re proactively working to learn the skills right now. 

Demonstrate Willingness to Learn:
  - Emphasize your eagerness and ability to learn and adapt. - Share examples from your past experiences where you quickly acquired new skills or knowledge.

Highlight Transferable Skills:
  - If you lack specific qualifications, focus on transferable skills. Explain how skills from previous roles or experiences can be applied to the new position.

Showcase Relevant Experience:
  - If you lack direct experience, emphasize any relevant experience or projects you've worked on that demonstrate your ability to handle similar tasks.

Mention Ongoing Learning Initiatives:
  - Discuss any courses, certifications, or training you are currently taking or plan to pursue to bridge your skill gaps.

Address Weaknesses in a Positive Light:
  - Frame your weaknesses as areas for growth and development, not as insurmountable obstacles. Show how you're eager to grow in these areas.

Ask Smart Questions:
  - During the interview, ask questions about how the company supports employee growth and development. This can indicate your interest in addressing your weaknesses.

Showcase Soft Skills:
  - Soft skills like communication, adaptability, problem-solving, and teamwork can often compensate for technical weaknesses. Highlight these skills.

Prepare for Behavioral Questions:
  - Be ready to answer behavioral interview questions that demonstrate your ability to handle challenging situations and adapt to change.

Focus on Fit and Values:
  - Emphasize your alignment with the company's culture and values, as this can offset certain skill gaps.
  - If you feel the interviewer has concerns about your weaknesses, directly address these concerns and provide additional examples of your potential and commitment to growth.

Remember that employers often appreciate candidates who are self-aware and proactive about addressing their weaknesses. It's about demonstrating your ability to recognize your limitations and your dedication to personal and professional development.
