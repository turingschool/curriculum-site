## Commitments from Students

- Deployed or it didn't happen: Everything must be deployed to heroku, github.io or some other publicly accessible place before it can be formally assessed or evaluated.
- You must tell us as soon as you can if you'd like to modify a requirement or expectation. Requirements are flexible, but not after the deadline
- If you want to work on something outside the curriculum, you'll need to find a way to do it on your own, or find a way to do it within your project.
- If you don't understand a concept, a deliverable, a purpose, or anything else we give you, it's up to you to ask the right questions to clarify. Sooner the better.

## Commitments from instructors

- Instructors will put together a curriculum that meets the learning goals we have developed
- Instructors will make adjustments to the curriculum as we become aware of issues. Students can help with this.
- Instructors will make time for one on one interactions, and will try to schedule extra time if you ask
- Instructors will work with you if you need to adjust your schedule or the requirements we've laid out
- Instructors are happy to clarify any task, requirement or deadline, as long as you ask
