## Overview 
The primary goal of the interview simulation, based on a selected job description (JD), is to provide students with realistic and practical experience of a job interview process.


### Learning Goals
1. Enhance Interview Skills: Help students develop and refine their interview skills, including answering questions, presenting their qualifications, and showcasing their suitability for the role.

2. Apply Knowledge: Enable students to apply the knowledge and insights gained from their research, such as the SWOT analysis and understanding of the role's requirements, to effectively communicate their alignment with the position.

3. Build Confidence: Boost students' confidence in handling interviews by simulating real-world scenarios. This practice helps reduce anxiety and improve their ability to perform well in actual job interviews.

4. Prepare for Real Interviews: Equip students with the ability to navigate the job market effectively, with a focus on matching their skills and interests to actual job openings. This, in turn, will enhance their chances of securing job opportunities that align with their career goals.

5. Receive Constructive Feedback: Provide students with constructive feedback from instructors and peers. This feedback can help them identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments before real job interviews.

By using a job description as the basis for the interview simulation, students can better connect their academic learning with practical career preparation and develop the skills necessary to succeed in their job search endeavors.

## Student Steps for Interview Preparation
Before the Interview Simulation in Week 5:

* Complete Parts 1 and 2 of the Case Study project:
    * Find one job role that aligns with your career interests and goals. This role will be the focus of your interview simulation.
    * Complete the Employer Persona research


* Submit Mock Interview Documents
    * Submit via the form on the calendar ([also linked here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmIo-SF8uxj9obkBEtxOSfPxQgycIYnL_kMBJBBZg23pbMFQ/viewform))
      * A copy of the Job Description that you've selected for the simulation
        * IMPORTANT: The job description should be copied into a google doc. Do not just send a link to the website with the posting. If the job posting is taken down, there is no record of the job description for you to reference.
      * A resume and cover letter tailored to the chosen role
    * This allows the instructor to prepare relevant interview questions based on the job description and your qualifications, ensuring a realistic and valuable interview experience.

* Create an Interview Preparation Document
    * Develop an interview preparation document that includes a list of common interview questions and space for your answers.
    * Also, include a section for questions you intend to ask during the interview. Research the company and the role to formulate insightful questions that demonstrate your genuine interest.
    * Use this document to practice your responses, ensuring you are well-prepared for the interview and able to showcase your qualifications effectively.
    * Take a look at these Interview Story Banks to use or get ideas for creating your own.
