## Starting Strong

Digital organizing and decluttering can reduce stress and feelings of overwhelm that can block our success, enhancing our productivity and overall well-being. Let's begin Mod 4 by organizing and decluttering our digital files, inboxes, resources, and other digital assets!

### Digital Organization - Implement

Use these prompts and tasks to guide your digital organization and decluttering process:  

- What applications do you use the most in your day-to-day? Are they easily and readily accessible for you?
- Experiment with ChatGPT! Try a prompt like: "Pretend to be Japanese organizing consultant Marie Kondo. Help me organize and declutter my digital environment." You can even give more specifics if there is an area of your environment you're trying to focus on.
- What doesn't need to be front and center in your digital space? What could be housed elsewhere? 
- Do you have the things you need backed up? Where do you save and store important information?
- Do you currently have a Job Hunt Tracker? Has it helped so far?
