### Warm Up:

In small groups, discuss the following:

- Reflect on job titles you‚Äôve had in the past. What does growth look like within those roles?
- If the opportunity presented itself would you return to your previous place of work as a different title?
- How do companies make sure new features don‚Äôt break their systems? Who they gonna call?  üëª

## IT Generalist to Manager of Technology

IT Generalist couldn't be a more vague title. Information Technology General has more of a ring to it but if you break IT Generalist down it's actually pretty cool if you ask me (the universal _me_). It's a person who is competent in several different fields within tech, and suprise, suprise, that's you (the universal _you_)! After finding himself on the job market for 6 months, Turing Alum Joe Fogiato 2211 was reached out to by a previous employer. He found himself back at MANNA, the company he was at prior to Turing. However, this time as an IT Generalist, he was able to pave his his own path after asking himself: ‚ÄúWhat else can I do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat does the organization need?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat are my career aspirations?‚Äù. He is now the Senior Manager of Technology and Continuous Improvement.

### Note
As small companies and non-profits begin to grow, or enter the modern era, it‚Äôs common for them to need a general ‚Äútechnology person‚Äù i.e. a IT Generalist.

Since starting at Turing, how many times have family members come to you with ‚Äúcomputer questions,‚Äù as if you‚Äôve suddenly become a wizard of technology? From ‚ÄúCan you fix the printer?‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow do I copy and paste on my phone?‚Äù‚ÄîI‚Äôve heard it all. While Joe isn‚Äôt fixing printers at work, he is the go-to tech expert at his job, building accessible platforms for clients and writing automated scripts, just to name a couple of his contributions. As a jack of all trades, Joe is constantly learning new things and solving problems with technology every day.

### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Technology Management & Integration**
    
    Oversee the cloud-based data warehouse, manage code changes, schema updates, integrations, and resolve technological pain points across departments. Administer day-to-day technology solutions to meet organizational needs.
    
2. **Strategic Planning & Implementation**
    
    Identify technology needs, strategize solutions, implement changes, and benchmark against organizational plans. Manage the IT budget and track savings through cost-reduction efforts.
    
3. **Security & Compliance Oversight**
    
    Serve as the internal Security Officer, ensuring data and technology security in collaboration with compliance officers and third-party providers. Monitor and mitigate risks, including cyber threats.
    
4. **Training & Documentation**
    
    Develop and lead staff training, workshops, and coaching. Create and maintain SOPs, training materials, and documentation to support processes, procedures, and security measures.
    
5. **Hardware, Software & Telecommunications**
    
    Manage the deployment, maintenance, and inventory of hardware and software. Ensure telecommunications infrastructure meets organizational requirements and aligns with emerging industry trends.

We got a chance to sit down with Joe and speak on what it's like being the go-to technology problem solving person at a non-profit. Check out the full interview below. Please forgive my congestion - I had a cold ü§ß

Click to 20:36 to be all kinds of inspired, but when asked if he could give any piece of advice, or final thoughts, to future job seekers he had this to say:

<section class="call-to-action">
***‚ÄúIf you come to Turing with a mindset, I just wanna learn how to code because I want this thing and I want this very linear, this is the thing I want. I think that there is more risk to that than keeping it broader saying‚Ä¶ I'll use myself as an example, I want a role where I use technology to solve problems for a mission that I care about. There are going to be way more roles and things you can do with that and you'll get to learn a lot more than if you're just like, no, I just want to be a software engineer. I don't want to do anything else. I think regardless of how the landscape shifts and jobs wise, that is always going to be something that exists and something that people want.‚Äù***

### Lets Try it! 

**Technology Problem-Solving**
    
  **Scenario:**
  The organization relies on a cloud-based data warehouse for storing and managing client data. Recently, users have reported difficulty accessing certain data fields after a schema update, impacting their ability to complete daily tasks.

  1. What steps would you take to investigate and resolve this issue?
  2. How would you ensure communication between the affected team and the technical team during this process?
  3. What documentation or training would you create to prevent this issue from happening again?

## Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
Similarly, Brennan Ayers 1903 found himself searching for a new job and was ‚Äúwilling to take anything." He came across a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Role and decided to pivot from devopment. A Site Reliability Engineer ensures that software systems are reliable, scalable, and efficient. They blend software engineering and operations to automate tasks like deployments, monitor system performance, and quickly resolve incidents. Their main goal is to maintain uptime while improving systems through automation and optimization.

### Key Responsibilities:

1. **System Reliability and Performance**
    - Ensure systems are highly available and meet defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
    - Monitor performance and troubleshoot outages to maintain uptime.
2. **Automation and Process Improvement**
    - Automate repetitive tasks like deployments, scaling, and incident recovery.
    - Reduce manual work (toil) to improve efficiency and reliability.
3. **Incident Response and Root Cause Analysis**
    - Handle and resolve system incidents quickly.
    - Conduct root cause analyses (RCAs) to prevent similar issues.
4. **Infrastructure Optimization**
    - Design and manage scalable, cost-efficient infrastructure.
    - Optimize system performance and plan for future growth.
5. **Monitoring, Observability, and Alerting**
    - Implement tools to track system health and detect anomalies.
    - Set up alerts and dashboards for better visibility into infrastructure.

We had the chance to chat with Brennan, who transitioned from a traditional engineering role to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). During our conversation, he shared insights into his journey into tech and his experiences as an SRE. Check out the full interview below!

### Lets Try it! 

**üö®¬†Keep the System Running! üö®**
    
  **Scenario:**
  Imagine you're a SRE at a super cool tech company who is responsible for maintaining the reliability of a web application. A critical service your team manages is experiencing slow performance during peak hours - losing money, ah! What steps would you take to identify and address the issue? Think about monitoring tools, automation, and collaboration with other teams.

## Wrap up

<section class="checks-for-understanding">
  #### In your notebook take some time to reflect on your experiences before Turing, the new skillset you‚Äôve acquired, and how those can be applied to Tech Manager and a SRE.

  - Describe some similarities and differences between a traditional Software Engineering role and someone who is a IT Generalist? SRE?
  - What are examples in your previous work experience where you leveraged your education/skillset to grow within your role?
  - Is there alignment between these roles and your previous experience / skillset? Begin to search job postings with these titles. Find 3 - 5 job postings that align with what you‚Äôre looking for.
  - What are some further questions you‚Äôd ask Joe or Brennan?
