### Deliverable 1: Complete Terminal or Personal portfolio
  * Students may choose to build a personal portfolio OR build a portfolio using Terminal
    * Follow [these directions](../../job_seekers/resources/terminal_directions.md) to update and submit your portfolio.
        * If you build your own portfolio, you should start with the "About Me Section" in the link above to guide the content you put on your portfolio.
    * Add at least 2 projects and use [these guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKePxhD-xQdLRPeLI21E71ET_U88ZZ-SKTQjRVzs8tM/edit) to help you create the descriptions
    * Upload your polished and targeted resume
    * Include the link to your LinkedIn that is updated and optimized for job search
    * **Due date #1: Friday of Week 4.** Make sure to "request review" by this date.
      * For Terminal portfolios, we will review and send follow-up on anything to be completed before it can be published.  Note: you must select "request review" on your Terminal portfolio and then we will review and publish it; it isn't fully complete until we publish it.
      * If you create a personal portfolio, you should DM a link to the Mod 4 instructors when it's ready for review.  
    * **Final due date: EOD Friday of Week 5.**  All updates to the portfolio must be made by this time to fulfill this deliverable.
