Your mental health is important! We know Turing is stressful. Here are
several resources that are available to you!
   

### Your instructors
  
If you feel comfortable reaching out to your instructors, we're always
happy to listen, and we can refer you to other staff members who can
assist you if you need further help than we can give. We also recommend joining the slack channel #health-wellness for
community wellness tips, reminders,
and events.

### Financial stress
For financial concerns, you can reach out directly to Tamika Shipp on
Slack; she can connect you with various services to help alleviate
financial stressors.
