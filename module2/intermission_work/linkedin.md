## Why do I need a LinkedIn?

With so much of the hiring process in tech being remote these days, using LinkedIn is critical for visibility in the job search. It also has lots of helpful tools for networking and applying. In Mod 2, we will be reviewing these tools and refining our profiles in order to maximize impact in the job search. 

If you've never used LinkedIn before, that's okay! Take a look at this [series of videos](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linkedin-22140720/get-started-with-linkedin?resume=false) that can walk you through its purpose and how to set it up. [This article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-use-linkedin-here-benefits-andrea-rodriguez/) discusses the benefits of the platform and would also be a helpful read for anyone new to LinkedIn.

## Required Prep for Mod 2

Please make sure you complete the following steps before our LinkedIn workshop in week 1. 

1. Sign up for a LinkedIn account
2. Upload a headshot. Don't have one? No problem! Check out [this blog](https://writing.turing.edu/how-to-take-your-own-linkedin-headshot/) and learn how to take your own!
3. Add a headline. At minimum, it can be "Software Engineer" (no need to write student!), but it can also include other components from your previous careers. We'll talk more about this in our workshop.
