## Deliverables:

First, create a new [Gist on Github](https://gist.github.com/). Copy and paste the markdown from [this template](https://gist.github.com/mikedao/cf0f63490a0ef91ac7d251e95fc410f7) into your gist.

This Gist will be your submission for your intermission work. Each of the assignments includes a Check for Understanding that you must complete in your Gist. Some of the assignments will also ask you to include a link to a GitHub repo.

**Deliverables are due 5:00 pm the Saturday before the module begins. Prework must be completed in its entirety in order to be successful in Mod 2.**

## Assignments

Work on the following assignments in order. Each assignment will assume that you have completed the previous one and the accompanying Checks for Understanding. **Ruby 3.2.2 and Rails 7.1.2 are required.**

Time-box recommendations are in each section's instructions, and also included here for convenience. 

1. Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), using your `@turing.edu` email address. 
   - This step sometimes takes a few days for GitHub to complete, but once you sign up for your credits you'll be able to take advantage of their benefits! 
   - Follow [these instructions](https://mod4.turing.edu/lessons/intermission/gh-student-instructions.html) to get the info you require to complete registration. **You do NOT need to complete the Heroku steps at this time!** Ask in #codehelp if you get stuck. 
2. [Ruby and Rails versions installation guide](./ruby_and_rails_versions.md)
3. [Get Module 2 Tools](./tools)
