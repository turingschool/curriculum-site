## Learning Goals

- Interpret User Stories to write tests
- Use TDD to implement desired functionality
- Understand how to breakdown, approach, and complete Independent Challenges


## The Plan

Prior to this session, you will have had 2 hours to work on an Independent Challenge (IC) that is sent to you by instructors. This review will occur after the timed IC, and will cover all user stories (except for any extensions). 

One instructor will demonstrate an approach to breaking down the tasks at hand, writing specs, and using those specs to guide implementation of the desired functionality.

You are welcome, and encouraged, to ask questions at any point during the live review. 


## Check for Understanding

In small groups, have each person answer the following questions: 

1. What is something you learned by watching this walkthrough?
2. Is there anything that hung you up when working on the IC on your own? Was that struggle addressed during this IC?
3. Is there anything that you would like more clarification on?

If the people in your small group are unable to answer any questions that come up from the last two questions above, please write them down, and bring them to the whole group once we come back from this breakout room.
