title: Representational State Transfer

## Learning Goals

- Explain CRUD in the context of web applications.
- Explain what is REST
- Be able to distinguish between a RESTful vs non-RESTful route.

## Vocabulary

- CRUD
- REST
- HTTP Verbs
- URI

## Warm Up

Based on your Task Manager App:

- What does CRUD stand for?
- Look at your Task Manager routes: what are the eight different method/path/controller#action combinations contained there?
- What does each one do?

## CRUD

- C - Create
- R - Read
- U - Update
- D - Delete

This is a list of the operations we can perform on a *resource*.

In this context, *resource* is a generic term for something that we have in our application (e.g. tasks, people, movies). Generally, each table we create in our database holds specific instances of a particular resource. We create, read, update and destroy resources in our database.

Often, our applications will have a separate controller and model for each resource.

## REST

- **Representational State Transfer** (ReST) is a web architecture style
- Coined by Roy Fielding in doctoral dissertation (2000)
- REST is a simple way to organize interactions between independent systems
- A map between HTTP verb/path combinations and CRUD actions users want to perform on a resource
- RESTful applications typically treat the web like a resource

## HTTP Verbs

- GET: retrieve a resource from a url
- POST: create a new resource
- PUT: update an entire resource
- PATCH: update part of a resource
- DELETE: remove/destroy a resource

Additional information from the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).

## URI

- **Uniform Resource Identifier**

In this context, the portion of the URL after the domain.

For the URL `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier`, the URI would be `/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier`.

**Think to yourself**

What is the URI for this address? `http://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781626722934`

## Seven RESTful Routes

Pull up the routes and TaskController from Task Manager. Let's see if you can [create a table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLaehcK8r_uBlmlKNcgGwCb7Mdq3w7Q2B1o7ilKFS0s/edit?usp=sharing) for seven RESTful routes allowing us to perform all CRUD actions on a Task. Include the following:

- Method (verb)
- Path/URI
- Controller
- Controller action
- What does it do?

**Complete the table. You can either make a copy of the spreadsheet, or diagram this in your notebook.**

Is there a command you can run from your terminal to help with the diagram? (HINT)

## Not So RESTful Routes

- Do research. What is an example of a non-RESTful route?
    - `/tasks/add`
    - `/tasks/show_all`
    - etc
    

## CFU

- What is each part of CRUD?
- What is REST?
- How do we combine CRUD and REST in web applications?
- Record a version of the restful routes table in your notes
