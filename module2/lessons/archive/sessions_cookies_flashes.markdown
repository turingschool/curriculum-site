## Learning Goals
* Understand how cookies are a part of the request/response cycle
* Explain different use cases for sessions, cookies, and flashes
* Understand how to store state in both cookies and sessions
* Practice the syntax for setting and fetching session data
* Practice setting flash messages based on conditionals

## Structure

* Whiteboard discussion: Request/Response Cycle
* Video, Reading, & Code Along
* Q&A + Begin Homework

## Code Along (at Your Own Pace)

Clone [Storedom](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/storedom).

Read the sections on "Sessions, Cookies, and Flashes" in this [article](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/sessions-cookies-and-authentication).

Code along with this [video](https://vimeo.com/130058574)

After the code along and reading, answer the questions in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/4ec903b9c5f32d29c568e4b7bab91123).

If you finish early...

* experiment with [`flash.now`](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#flash-now)
* read this blog post about [hacking Rails](http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/22/how-to-hack-a-rails-app-using-its-secret-token/) from 2013. Some of the content in this article is out of date but the concepts still apply.

## Q&A

What questions do you still have? Why do we need sessions & cookies?
