### Talkin' 'Bout Feelings

This format is used when wrapping up group projects. The goal is to encourage open, positive, and actionable feedback.

##### Group Reflection

* Get together with your Traffic Spy team. One person will create a new [gist](http://gist.github.com) for taking notes.
* Discuss the following questions:

  1. What habits of your group members are you hoping to adopt?
  1. Give an example of something you think too much time was spent on (bad choices, rabbit holes etc).
    * What led to that?
    * How can you prevent that in the future?
    * Did your decisions improve as the project went on?

  1. Give examples for each of the following areas:
    * Technical things that pushed the team forward.
    * Non-technical things that pushed the team forward.
    * Technical things that hindered the team. 
    * Non-technical things that hindered the team.

  1. What steps did you take to manage stress that were effective both individually and as a team?
