## Full-Group Instruction

### Anatomy of an HTML Page

Clone the TuringBistro [repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-bistro). As a group, we're going to go through the `index.html` in this repository and discuss the components. Feel free to interject and ask questions at this time.

#### Additional Discussion Points

* Chrome Developer Tools
* `class` vs. `id`
* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

### CSS Refresher

As a group, we'll discuss the basics of CSS selectors and properties. Feel free to interject and ask questions.

#### Additional Discussion Points

* `normalize.css`

## Independent Challenges

In pairs, style the `index.html` page using `main.css` in the `stylesheets` folder.

You have two constraints:

* You can't change any of the HTML markup
* You can't use JavaScript

### Must Knows

* Center the container
* Remove the underline from the hyperlinks
* Change the style of the hyperlinks when a mouse hovers over them
* Make the items in the navigation align horizontally
* Move the announcements to a side bar

### Nice to Haves

* Prefix each of the menu prices with a dollar sign ($)
* Style the menu items like a traditional menu you'd find at a restaurant
* Gradually transition the color of a hyperlink when a mouse hovers over it
* Float the Turing Logo to the left or the right

### Challenging

* Make the page responsive to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Wrap-Up

* What was challenging?
* What areas are still unclear to you?
* What are you proud of?
