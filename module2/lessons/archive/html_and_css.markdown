## Full-Group Instruction

### Anatomy of an HTML Page

As a group, we're going to go through the `index.html` in [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-bistro][repo] and discuss all of the components. Feel free to interject and ask questions at this time.

### CSS Refresher

As a group, we'll discuss the basics of CSS selectors and properties. Feel free to interject and ask questions.

## Independent Challenges

Fork [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-bistro][repo] and style the `index.html` in [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-bistro][repo] using any of the stylesheets in the `css` folder. You may work in pairs or individually.

You have two constraints:

* You can't change any of the HTML markup
* You can't use JavaScript

### Beginning

* Center the container
* Remove the underline from the hyperlinks
* Change the style of the hyperlinks when a mouse hovers over them
* Prefix each of the menu prices with a dollar sign ($)

### Intermediate

* Make the items in the navigation align horizontally
* Style the menu items like a traditional menu you'd find at a restaurant
* Float the Turing Logo to either the left or the right

### Challenging

* Move the announcements to a side bar
* Gradually transition the color of a hyperlink when a mouse hovers over it
* Make the page responsive to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Wrap-Up

* Submit a pull request with your page.
* Let's go around for 1 minute each and give a lightning introduction to your page design.
* Revisit your gist from the warm up. What areas are still unclear to you? Open an issue on [https://github.com/turingschool-examples/turing-bistro][repo] so your instructor can respond to you.
