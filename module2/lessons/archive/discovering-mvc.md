### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will know/be able to:

* Explain the purpose of a router in rails
* Explain the purpose of a controller in rails
* Explain the purpose of a model in rails
* Explain the purpose of a view in rails
* Diagram MVC structure

### Structure

#### MVC and Rails apps

* Rails follows the MVC structure for applications. A request is sent over the web, it makes its way to our Rails app, then what? How does the app take that request and get the necessary data and/or perform the necessary task?

#### Arts and Crafts time!

Let's draw! Time to get out some pens, markers, pencils, chalk, sharpies, paints - whatever - and draw ourselves the MVC structure in rails.

#### Review

Fork [this](https://gist.github.com/Carmer/571cc0df8730dc3e3fd86c1571ede127) gist and answer the questions.
