## Sequence

### Setup (5 min)

* DM your partner a link to your repo.
* Clone your partner's repo.
* Create a gist and copy/paste the project rubric twice (one for evaluating your partner's project and one for self-evaluating your own project).

### Review I (15 min)

Review your partner's project against the rubric below. Save your scores in the gist.

### Review II (20 min)
Review your own project against the rubric. Save your scores in the gist.

Also, take a few minutes to identify some code that you think represents your best work and some that represents your worst. Make note of these in your gist (see if you can figure out how to link directly to this code on Github)

### BREAK (5 min)

### Share I (10 min)
Pick one project to start with. Compare your scores to those of your partner and calibrate where there are discrepancies.

Pitch your strongest and weakest pieces of code and discuss.

### Share II (10 min)
Switch projects and do the same.
