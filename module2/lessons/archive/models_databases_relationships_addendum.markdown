### One-to-Many Relationships

#### At the Database Level: Articles and Authors

Let's discuss:

* What is a migration?
* What does `t.timestamps` in the migration file give us?

Let's do:

1. First, we'll create a model: `rails generate model Author first_name:text last_name:text`. The model generator creates a model, a migration, and two files related to testing.

Let's look at the migration inside of `db/migrate`:

```ruby
class CreateAuthors < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :authors do |t|
      t.text :first_name
      t.text :last_name

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Let's look at the model `author.rb`:

```
class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

It also creates a model test and a fixtures file to use for testing. More on this in a future lesson.

**In your gist**:

* What files are created by typing `rails g model ...`?

*Notes:*

* `rails g model ...` is shorthand for `rails generate model ...`
* You can also create a model without the attributes from the command line (`rails generate model Author`) but you'll then need to add the attributes into the migration file by hand.
* You can create the migration and the model separately like this: `rails g migration CreateAuthors first_name:text last_name:text` then `touch app/models/author.rb` and adding the two lines of code to define the author class.

* `rails generate model Something` will generate a model and a migration
* `rails generate model Something name:string age:integer` will generate model and migration with those attributes
* Change vs. Up/Down
* Common methods: `add_column`, `create_table` (automatically will generate a primary key), `remove_column`, `drop_table` (these methods take arguments)
* common column types: boolean, string, text, integer, date, datetime
* setting up relationships in a migration using id columns
* column modifier examples: `:null => false` `:default => 0` (more [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html))
* everything in the migration is executable code (but use a seed file to generate seed data)
* `rake db:migrate` migrates development
* schema.rb contains snapshot of current database structure
* you (generally) don't need to do rake db:test:prepare or RACK_ENV=test rake db:migrate with Rails testing; running `rake test` will load the schema to the test database
* `rake db:rollback` or `rake db:rollback STEP=2` to reverse migrations
* `rake db:drop` and `rake db:create` to wipe out database and recreate it

**In your gist**:

* What's the difference between typing `rails g model ...` and `rails g migration ...`?
* Imagine that the `items` table has a category called `quantity`. What command would you type if you wanted to get rid of the `quantity` attribute?

#### What is ActiveRecord?

* Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework
* connects objects in an application to relational database
* represent models and their data
* represent associations between models
* validate models before they are saved in database

### Models

#### Demonstration with Article model

* inheriting from ActiveRecord::Base -- additional class methods and instance methods
* naming of database tables (snake_case) vs. models (CamelCase)
* example ActiveRecord class methods: `all`, `count`, `find`, `find_by`, `where`
* example ActiveRecord instance methods: `update`, `destroy`, `save`, `attribute?`, `new_record?`
* you don't need to use `initialize` method
* click [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) for more on ActiveRecord basics

**In your gist**:

* Imagine that you have a table `students`. What is the ActiveRecord query that would return all students with the first name of `Richard`?
* How would you update the student record with ID 4 to have a new phone number of "101-222-3333"?

### Associations

#### Demonstration of One-to-Many Relationships at the Model Level: Article/Author

* ActiveRecord Associations:
* has_many - this is a method
* belongs_to - this is a method

### Many-to-Many

#### Many-to-Many at the Database Level: articles, tags, and article_tags tables

* need three tables
* join table holds foreign keys for each of the other two tables

#### Many-to-Many at the Model Level: Article/Tag/ArticleTag models

* join tables: `has_many :things` and `has_many :things, through: :other_things` - this is a method with an argument
* order matters
