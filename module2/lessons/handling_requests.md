# Handling HTTP Requests

Our Rails app's responsibility is to receive HTTP Requests and send back HTTP Responses. When we start our server with `rails server` or `rails s`, we are telling our app to wait patiently for a client to send it a request. When our app receives a request, our app then needs to handle the request. This includes both what should happen in the database (CRUD), and what response (HTML) should be sent back to the client.

### Verb and Path

Every request needs to be able to tell a server *what* information is requested and *how* that information is being requested. The *what* is the **path** (also known as a **URI**), indicating what resource this request is referencing.

Examples of a path:

- `/tasks`
- `/tasks/4`
- `/items/6/reviews`

The *how* is the **verb**, indicating what actions the server should take regarding the requested resource. While the path can vary greatly based on the application, the verbs follow common patterns. There are 5 common HTTP verbs:

- GET - retrieve some information to be READ by the client/user
- POST - CREATE a new resource with information contained in the request
- PUT - UPDATE an entire resource with information contained in the request
- PATCH - UPDATE a part of a resource with information contained in the request
- DELETE - DESTROY a resource, typically indicating that it is removed from the database

With these 5 verbs, a client can send requests that allow our app to perform all CRUD functions (create, read, update, destroy) for resources in the database.

## What is a "URL"?

Users tell a client to ask for information by giving it a **URL**: a Universal Resource Locator.

A URL allows us to send data to, or retrieve, a "resource" on the Internet. A resource could be a page of HTML content, it could be an image or music file, or it could be part of a web application that will save data you send to it.

### URL vs URI/Path

You may also hear the term URI used interchangeably with "path" when talking about things on the Internet. A "URI", or "Universal Resource Identifier" is not the same as a URL, but it's easy to confuse them.

A URI is part of a URL (see below).

### Parts of a URL

Following the example of this URL: 

```
http://task-manager.herokuapp.com/task/new?title=New&task=Task#new_form_anchor
```

We can take this example and split it into distinct parts:

- Protocol: `http://` - Tells us the application protocol we will be using to interact on the web.
- Domain: `task-manager.herokuapp.com` - Tells us where the resources we are trying to access are located (tied to an IP address using DNS).
- **URI** or "Path": `/task/new` - The specific path for the resources that we are trying to access at that location.
- Query String: `?title=New&task=Task` - Params that give our server additional information about what we would like to access.
- Fragment Identifier: `#new_form_anchor` - An indicator of a specific section of a website we would like to view (e.g. if there is an anchor tag tied to a heading half way down the page). This can be seen by visiting [this](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#array-conditions) link to the rails docs which references the `array-conditions` section of the Query Interface page.

# SetList

Now that we have some background in URLs, Paths, and HTTP Request/Responses, let's put it all together to design a feature in a new app we will be developing together, SetList.

In SetList, we want Users to have the ability to manage Songs, so our first task will be to allow users to see (READ) all Songs. Here is the behavior we are looking for:

- A user opens a web browser and types this URL into their address bar: `http://localhost:3000/songs`
    - Note that we are using the domain `localhost:3000` because we are developing locally. When this app is live on the internet, it will have a different domain. If we are hosting on Heroku, it will have a domain name like `set-list.herokuapp.com`, so the request to that site would be `http://set-list.herokuapp.com/songs`
- When the user hits enter, an HTTP request will be sent. That request will have two key pieces of information
    - An HTTP Verb of `GET` (URLs entered into an address bar will default to GET)
    - A Path (or URI) of `/songs`
- Upon receiving that request, our App should send back an HTTP response of an HTML page that shows all of the songs

## Create your app

> "Convention over Configuration"
> 
- From [The Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration) by David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) in January, 2016

Let's create a whole new Rails app. We're going to use this codebase for the rest of the inning in mod 2.

```bash
$ rails new set_list -T --database=postgresql
$ cd set_list
```

- `T` - Rails has minitest by default. When this flag is used, `gem 'minitest'` will not be in the Gemfile.
- `-database=postgresql` - by default, Rails uses `sqlite3`. We want to tell it to use `postgresql` instead because platforms we use for deploying our projects will expect to use a PostgreSQL database.

Take a few minutes to explore what `rails new` generates.

## Gems

Add `pry` to your `group :development, :test` block in your Gemfile. 

**Gemfile**

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  # See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#debugging-with-the-debug-gem
  gem "debug", platforms: %i[ mri mingw x64_mingw ]
  gem "pry"
end
```

Always run `bundle install` whenever you update your Gemfile.****

## Create the Database

If you try to run your server with `rails s` and visit `localhost:3000` in your browser you will see the error:

`FATAL: database "set_list_development" does not exist`

Let's create our app's database with

```bash
$ rails db:create
```

Refresh the page and you should see a big red Rails logo.

## Routing the Request

Our first error when we visit `localhost:3000/songs` is a RoutingError `No route matches [GET] "/songs"`.

Rails doesn't know how to route a `GET` request to `/songs`, so let's tell it how to do that.

**config/routes.rb**

```bash
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/songs", to: "songs#index"
end
```

Remember, an HTTP request includes both the verb (`GET` in this case) and the path (`/songs`).

The second argument, `to: "songs#index"`, tells Rails what controller action should handle the request. The format is `<controller>#<action>`. In this format, the controller name is snaked case. Rails will interpret this snake case into a camel-cased controller name. For example, `to: snake_cased_names#index` would look for a `SnakeCasedNames` controller.

From the command line, we can see which routes we have available by running 

```bash
$ rails routes
```

We should see this output:

```bash
Prefix Verb URI Pattern      Controller#Action
songs  GET  /songs(.:format) songs#index
```

This means whenever a `get` VERB is used in a request to the path `/songs`, the application will look at a "Songs" controller, and look for an "action method" in there called `index`.

Don't worry about the `(.:format)` piece on the end of the URI pattern. You'll use that more in mod3 and allows us to retrieve resource data in different formats than HTML, such as CSV or XML.

**Based on our Rails routes, what controller do we need? Do we have it?**

Let's refresh our browser request to `localhost:3000/songs`.

```bash
uninitialized constant SongsController
```

Make a songs controller.

```bash
$ touch app/controllers/songs_controller.rb
```

Naming is important. The **name of the file should be the plural of what it is handling** (in this case, songs).

****app/controllers/songs_controller.rb****

```ruby
class SongsController < ApplicationController

end
```

Notice that the name of the class matches the name of the file (`songs_controller.rb` => `class SongsController`), the file is "snake-cased" and the class name is "camel-cased".

What is ApplicationController? Look at the controllers folder and you should see an `application_controller.rb` file. This file defines the `ApplicationController` class, which (generally) all of your other controllers will inherit from. This is very similar to how we have an `ApplicationRecord` which all of our models inherit from.

When we refresh our browser, we get this error:

```bash
The action 'index' could not be found for SongsController
```

Let's add the index action.

**app/controllers/songs_controller.rb**

```bash
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end
end
```

An `action` in the context of a rails app is a `method` defined inside a Controller.

We have now successfully routed our request to a controller action.

### Rendering the View

Refresh the page again and you should see this error.

```bash
ActionController::UnknownFormat:
    SongsController#index is missing a template for request formats text/html

    NOTE!
    Unless told otherwise, Rails expects an action to render a template with the same name,
    contained in a folder named after its controller. If this controller is an API responding with 204 (No Content),
    which does not require a template, then this error will occur when trying to access it via browser,
    since we expect an HTML template to be rendered for such requests. If that's the case, carry on.
```

Remember, HTTP consists of both requests and **responses**. 

At this point, we have set up our App to receive a request, but haven't told it how to respond. By default, rails will try to respond by rendering a view. It automatically looks for a view folder with the same name as the controller (`app/views/songs` folder), then look for a template file with the same name as the action method (`index.html.erb`). We can override this behavior by using the `render` or `redirect` commands, but for now we will follow the Rails convention.

```bash
$ mkdir app/views/songs
$ touch app/views/songs/index.html.erb
```

Rails convention says that we should include the output format type in the filename and then the `.erb` extension. That's why this file is `index.html.erb` rather than `index.erb`. The latter would work, but it would not be following convention.

Refresh your page and you should see a blank page. We have successfully rendered a response.

Before we move on. Lets pry.

****app/controllers/songs_controller.rb****

```ruby
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    binding.pry
  end
end
```

Refresh the page and check the terminal where the server is running. You should see something like:

```ruby
Started GET "/songs" for ::1 at 2020-10-06 15:58:55 -0600
Processing by SongsController#index as HTML

From: /Users/tim_tyrrell/staff_turing/2mod/explorations/set_list_2008/app/controllers/songs_controller.rb:3 SongsController#index:

   2: def index
=> 3:   require "pry"; binding.pry
   4: end

[1] pry(<SongsController>)>
```

Lets start here. Your controllers and views have access to both a **request** AND **response** object that Rails builds for you with each request.

Type in `request` in your pry session.

...

That's not incredibly helpful, because it's an overload of information that we need to parse through. But, what if we scope the inspection of this request object to be more specific?

Type in `ls request` in your pry session.

This will list all of the methods available for the `request` object

Try these 3 methods in your pry session: `request.get?` `request.path` `request.base_url?`

Now we're getting much more helpful information.

Lets look at the **response** object:

Type in `ls response` in your pry session.

This will list all of the methods available for the `response` object

Try these 3 methods in your pry session: `response.status` `response.body` `response.sent?`

Remember that each of these objects will have a plethora of relevant information about the request/response cycle at any given time.

## Database Setup

We want this page to show all the Songs from our database. Let's set up our Songs table.

We are going to need a **migration** in order to create a table. Any time we need to alter the structure of our database, we are going to do so with a migration. Some other examples of what you might need a migration for:

- Creating a Table
- Adding/removing a column from a table
- Renaming a table/column
- Much More

Luckily, Rails gives us some built in syntax for generating migrations:

```bash
$ rails g migration CreateSongs title:string length:integer play_count:integer
```

Look inside the `db/migrate` folder and you should see a file named something like `20190422213736_create_songs.rb`. That number at the beginning is a timestamp, so yours will be different. Inside it, you should see:

```ruby
class CreateSongs < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    create_table :songs do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.integer :length
      t.integer :play_count

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

We have written the instructions for our database but haven't executed those instructions. Run `rails db:migrate`.

Our Database should be good to go.

## Song Model

Now that we have our table set up, we will need to create a corresponding Model in order to interact with that table from our Ruby code.

```bash
$ touch app/models/song.rb
```

Note that our model files will always be named in singular form (`song.rb`, not `songs.rb`)

******app/models/song.rb******

```ruby
class Song < ApplicationRecord
end
```

We want this model to inherit from `ActiveRecord` so why are we using `ApplicationRecord`  instead? If we take a look around, we see a file in the `app/models` directory called  `application_record.rb`. Open that and peek around:

******app/models/application_record.rb******

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true
end
```

That file inherits from `ActiveRecord` already, so if we inherit from `ApplicationRecord` then we'll also inherit `ActiveRecord`. This allows us to have a parent model that could contain some shared methods/behaviors.

## Creating Songs

In order to see Songs on our index page, we are going to need to create some Songs. We might later add in a feature where can create a new song with a form, but we don't have the feature yet, so we are going to have to insert Songs into our database manually.

Let's open up the Rails console with `rails console` or `rails c` from the command line.

The Rails console will give you access to your development database through your models. If you enter `Song.all` into the console, you should get back an empty ActiveRecord Relation. This is because we don't have any Songs in our database yet, so let's create some:

```bash
irb(main):015:0> Song.create(title: "I Really Like You", length: 208, play_count: 23546543)
irb(main):016:0> Song.create(title: "Call Me Maybe", length: 431, play_count: 8759430)
```

You should see this output:

```bash
(0.3ms)  BEGIN
  Song Create (0.5ms)  INSERT INTO "songs" ("title", "length", "play_count", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) RETURNING "id"  [["title", "I Really Like You"], ["length", 208], ["play_count", 23546543], ["created_at", "2020-08-10 20:45:58.643242"], ["updated_at", "2020-08-10 20:45:58.643242"]]
   (0.5ms)  COMMIT

...
   (0.4ms)  BEGIN
  Song Create (0.4ms)  INSERT INTO "songs" ("title", "length", "play_count", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) RETURNING "id"  [["title", "Call Me Maybe"], ["length", 431], ["play_count", 8759430], ["created_at", "2020-08-10 20:46:21.379206"], ["updated_at", "2020-08-10 20:46:21.379206"]]
   (1.7ms)  COMMIT
```

You can see in this output that our ActiveRecord commands were translated into SQL to insert new rows into the database.

Now if we do `Song.all`, we should see some Songs coming back from our Database.

## Displaying Songs in the View

Now that we have Songs in our Database, let's retrieve them in our controller action:

****app/controllers/songs_controller.rb****

```ruby
class SongsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @songs = Song.all
  end
end
```

Remember, any instance variables you create in the controller action will be available in the view.

Let's display these songs in the view:

******app/views/songs/index.html.erb******

```html
<h1>All Songs</h1>

<% @songs.each do |song| %>
  <h2><%= song.title %></h2>
  <p>Play Count: <%= song.play_count %></p>
<% end %>
```

Start up your rails server: `rails server` or `rails s` from the command line.

Navigate to `localhost:3000/songs` to see your songs.

Put a pry in your views at any point to inspect your variables!
