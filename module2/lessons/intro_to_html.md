## Learning Goals

  - Understand structure of an HTML page
  - Understand difference between semantic/non-semantic tags
  - Understand difference between block and inline elements
  - Identify different parts of an HTML tag

## Vocabulary
  - HTML
  - Tag
  - Element
  - Semantic
  - Block
  - Inline

## WarmUp
Review from Task Manager
  - What file extension did we use for HTML files?
  - What does that file extension stand for?
  - How did we create structure in our HTML?

### Hyper Text Markup Language

A Markup Language used for describing the structure/layout of web pages.

Some HTML tags are "containers" for content, and some tags **are** the content.

### Structure of an HTML Document

  - General Structure:

  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chonburi|Muli">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type=text/css href="../stylesheets/main.css">
        <script type="text/javascript" src="javascript.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
    </html>
  ```
  - Let's talk about the specific parts:

#### [Type Declaration](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp)

  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells our browsers that our application is using HTML5 (this is NOT an html tag, but rather just an instruction the browser about our HTML version).
  - `<html>` signals the beginning of our HTML.

#### Head

  - Contains all the metadata (information *about* the document)
  - The ones we care about right now are:
    - `<title>` - The title that will show in the tab of your browser.
    - `<link>` - How we link to external stylesheets, i.e. our CSS. We want this in the head so it loads first. We could also style right in our html document with a `style` tag but DON'T DO THAT.
    It is considered an empty element and only contains attributes.
    Attributes include rel(relationship) type(Internet media type) href (specifies the URL of the page the link goes to)
    - `<script>` - How we link to our client-side statements (JavaScript).

#### Body

  - Contains ALL the elements of the HTML document that we would like to display.

#### Looking at layout.erb in SetList

```ruby
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title></title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chonburi|Muli">
      <link rel="stylesheet" type=text/css href="../stylesheets/main.css">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="javascript.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <%= yield %>
    </body>
  </html>
```

What is this `<%= yield %>` doing?
This is used in a 'layout level template' to help us 'DRY' up our HTML.
Now instead of needing to repeat the above in every erb/html file we can simply write the html that we want our body to contain.

### Semantic vs Non-Semantic Tags

  - How did you create HTML structure in your Task Manager app? Most everyone uses `<div>` tags at first.

#### Non-Semantic

  - `div`s - incredibly common but with the introduction of HTML5, there was a move towards semantic tags.
  - `div`s tell us NOTHING about the content of the element.  
  - A good use case for a `div` might be creating an element on a page like a solid box.

  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Our Zoo</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class="nav">
          <h1>Welcome to Our Zoo</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="animals">
          <div class="otters">
            <h2>Cuddly Otters</h2>
            <p>Come visit our friendly otters and watch them slip and slide.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="penguins">
            <h2>Cute Penguins</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Emperor Penguins</li>
              <li>King Penguins</li>
              <li>African Penguins</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="exhibits">
          <div class="explore-the-shore">
            <a href="https://www.denverzoo.org/explore-shore">Explore the Shore</a>
          </div>
          <div class="lorikeet-adventure">
            <p>Come play with out lorikeets.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="contact-me">
          <p>email me at <a href="mailto:dione@turing.edu"></a></p>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```

#### Semantic Tags

  - Can act the same as a `div` but have implied meaning.
  - Some examples of semantic tags:
    * `<article>`
    * `<aside>`
    * `<details>`
    * `<figcaption>`
    * `<figure>`
    * `<footer>`
    * `<header>`
    * `<main>`
    * `<mark>`
    * `<nav>`
    * `<section>`
    * `<summary>`
    * `<time>`
    * See more information about the specific tags [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

  Example:   

  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Our Zoo</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <nav>
          <h1>Welcome to Our Zoo</h1>
        </nav>
        <section class="animals">
          <header>
            <p>I would like to tell you about our animals</p>
          </header>
          <article class="otters">
            <h2>Otters</h2>
            <p>Come visit our friendly otters and watch them slip and slide.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="penguins">
            <h2>Cute Penguins</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Emperor Penguins</li>
              <li>King Penguins</li>
              <li>African Penguins</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="exhibits">
          <header>
            <p>Check out our exhibits!</p>
          </header>
          <article class="explore-the-shore">
            <a href="https://www.denverzoo.org/explore-shore">Explore the Shore</a>
          </article>
          <article class="lorikeet-adventure">
            <p>Come play with our lorikeets.</p>
          </article>
        </section>
        <footer class="contact-me">
          <p>email me at <a href="mailto:dione@turing.edu"></a></p>
        </footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```
  - A lot of the tags we use are already semantic such as form, link, etc.

### Display Properties: Block vs. Inline
  - The default value for all HTML tags is `inline`. Most "User Agent stylesheets" (the default styles the browser applies) reset many elements to `block`
  - The display value can be changed with the CSS property `display`.

#### Block
  - An element with a display of block will take up the entire width of the page, no matter how small the content is within the tag.
  - It will always start on a new line.
  - `p`, `form`, `h1 - h6`, `ul`, `section` and `div`s are all block elements

#### Inline
  - `link`, `a`, `span` are all inline by default.
  - They will only take up as much space as it needs.
  - It will not start on a new line.
  - You can set the margin and padding but it will only adjust horizontally. Will ignore any rules for width or height.

#### Inline-Block
  - Will situate itself inline, but can set a width and height.

### HTML Tag Attributes - The Break Down

#### Example 1

  - `<section class="tasks" id="all-tasks">`
    - `class` - used for several elements.
    - `id` - used for one element. Takes higher priority in CSS (more on this later).

#### Example 2

  - `<input name="task[title]" value="Enter Task Here">`
    - Seen in our forms.
    - Seen mostly in `input` or `button`.
    - `name` - the key the data submitted will have.
    - `task[title]` - the nested parameter value that maps to the key `name`. Typically entered by the user. More on this nested parameter in our "Passing Data" lesson.
    - `value` - the value we want the `input` or `button` to have when the page is rendered.

### Recap

  - What type of information belongs in the head of an HTML document?
  - Why would we use semantic vs. non-semantic tags?
  - What is the difference between a block and inline element?
  - When should we use an `id` over a `class`?
  - How do we use `name` and `value`?
