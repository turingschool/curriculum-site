Students will gain best practices and resources for setting up and having casual conversations with industry professionals. Through those conversations and some structured reflection spaces we will provide, students will gain clarity on what it means to be a developer and what matters most to them as they begin a new career. These experiences will allow students to continue refining their professional story and gain confidence with their ability to network. Since LinkedIn is a reflection of their professional story, students will be provided a space to further workshop their LinkedIn profiles and get feedback.

*Students will demonstrate professional readiness to move to Mod 3 by sharing their LinkedIn profile that meets expectations, and thoughtful reflections on their conversations with industry professionals in their Final Portfolio Review.*
