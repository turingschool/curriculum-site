## Learning Goals

- Understand what the `resources` syntax in `routes.rb` generates for us.
- Understand what nesting `resources` in `routes.rb` generates for us.
- Understand the 5 pieces of information `rails routes` gives us.
- Use route helpers
- Understand the difference between namespacing and nested `resources``

## Vocabulary

- routes
- route helper
- namespace

## Set Up
For part of this lesson we'll use the `advanced-routing` branch of the Set List Tutorial [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/set-list-7/tree/advanced-routing). 

## Warm Up

In your notebook, without using your computer, fill in the following table for the 8 ReSTful routes for a generic "resource”

Include the following for each:

- Verb
- URI Pattern
- Controller#Action

## Rails Resources

Rails gives us a handy shortcut for generating the 8 ReSTful routes in our routes.rb file. Open up any Rails app, such as SetList, and add the following line anywhere in your routes file:

**config/routes.rb**

```ruby
resources :dogs
```

Run `rails routes -c dogs` from the command line. The `-c` stands for controller, so it will only show you routes for the dogs.

With a partner, explore what this output gives you.

## Only/Except

You never want to create routes that you haven't implemented in your code. If you have `resources :dogs` in your routes file, but you haven't implemented the `DogsController#destroy` action, you would be exposing an unused route. Instead, we give our resource an `only` option to explicitly say which ReSTful routes we want created. For example, if we only wanted the dogs index, new, and create actions, we could put this in our routes file.

**config/routes.rb**

```ruby
resources :dogs, only: [:index, :new, :create]
```

You can also use `except`, which will generate the 8 ReSTful routes *except* the ones specified.

**config/routes.rb**

```ruby
resources :dogs, except: [:destroy]
```

This would be the same as:

**config/routes.rb**

```ruby
resources :dogs, only: [:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update]
```

Note: Generally its better to use `only` and not `except` because it’s easier to think in terms of positive rather than negative, and it’s preferred to use `only` instead of `except` even if it results in longer code.

With a partner, refactor some of the ReSTful routes in SetList to use the `resources` syntax.

## Nested Resources

Some resources are logically dependent on other resources. In SetList, Songs can't exist without an Artist.

If we look in our routes for SetList, we'll see:

```ruby
get "/artists/:artist_id/songs/new", to: "songs#new"
```

When we want to make a new song, we need to know which artist we are making the song for. We can also accomplish this with the `resources` syntax by nesting with a `do` block:

```ruby
resources :artists do
  resources :songs
end
```

This will generate 8 ReSTful routes for artists *and* 8 ReSTful routes for songs that are nested under an artist. You can also use only/except for nested resources:

```ruby
resources :artists, only: [:show] do
  resources :songs, only: [:edit]
end
```

Just like before, we only want to create the routes we need.

With a partner, refactor the nested routes in SetList to use the `resources` syntax.

## What's the difference between Nested Resources and Namespacing?

Namespacing a route is an organizational tool that helps us categorize routes. Take a look at this routes file:

```ruby
	    resources :songs, only: [:index]
	    namespace :admin do
	      resources :songs, only: [:index, :show]
	    end
```

While this might look similar to nested resources, the routes it will produce are different. The paths listed under `namespace` will have `/admin/` tacked on the beginning of them, but `admin` itself is not a resource. It does not map to a database table like `artists` and it does not have associated IDs. In this case, prepending the routes with `admin` is purely for organization and categorization. Using namespacing is akin to putting existing routes in a folder called `admin`. Take a look at what `rails routes` will output for these routes. 

```ruby 
         Prefix 	Verb   	URI Pattern                	Controller#Action
           songs 	GET    	/songs(.:format)            songs#index
     admin_songs 	GET  		/admin/songs(.:format)      admin/songs#index
			admin_song 	GET    	/admin/songs/:id(.:format) 	admin/songs#show
```

When creating a controller for actions that come from namespaced routes, it's conventional to declare the namespace title as a module, like so:

`class Admin::SongsController < ApplicationController`

The path for the above controller in the application's file directory would likely be `controllers/admin/songs_controller.rb`. Note the `admin` sub-directory. 

## Route Helpers

If you run `rails routes`, you'll notice the first column is called "prefix". Rails will use the "prefix" column to build route helpers.

Route helpers will generate a path for you (note: just the path, not the VERB). All you have to do is append `_path` to the end of the prefix name. For example, if you have this in your routes:

```ruby
resources :dogs, only: [:index]
```

Then `rails routes -c dogs` should give you:

```bash
Prefix Verb URI Pattern     Controller#Action
  dogs GET  /dogs(.:format) dogs#index
```

Using that prefix `dogs` we can use `dogs_path` anywhere in our Rails app to generate the path `/dogs`.

Generally, any row in your `rails routes` output that does not include a prefix uses the same prefix as the line above it.

## Passing Parameters to Route Helpers

Some paths include parameters. For example:

```ruby
resources :dogs, only: [:show]
```

Gives you this `rails routes` output:

```bash
Prefix Verb URI Pattern         Controller#Action
   dog GET  /dogs/:id(.:format) dogs#show
```

You can’t generate the path using `dog_path`  because it is expecting to be passed an `:id`. Any time a route helper needs a dynamic parameter like `:id`, we MUST pass a value to the route helper. For example, `dog_path(29)` will generate `/dogs/29`.

We can also pass an object rather than the actual value of the parameter and Rails is smart enough to extract that object's id. This below, is considered best practice.

```ruby
journey = Artist.create(name: 'Journey')
visit artist_path(journey)
```

Be careful. If you forget to pass a parameter to a route helper that needs it, the error message will start to look like a "missing route" error. Read the ENTIRE error, and it will actually tell you that the route helper is missing a parameter.

## Partner Practice

Refactor some of the code in setlist to use Route Helpers rather than hardcoded routes.

## Checks for Understanding

- What are the 8 ReSTful routes and their controller/actions?
- What routes would `resources :dogs, only: [:destroy, :index]` generate?
- What routes would the following generate?

```ruby
resources :owners, only: [:index] do
  resources :dogs, only: [:show]
end
```

- Why should you use `only`/`except`?
- How can you use the prefix column from `rails routes`?
