---

## Learning Goals

Promoted students will demonstrate proficiency in the material outlined in Module 2.

## Projects

All projects are graded. You must submit every project to be eligible for promotion.  

Students must earn a passing score on either the Paired or Group projects, and must pass the Week 6 Final Solo Project in order to be promoted to Module 3. 

* Weeks 1 - 2 Solo Project
* Week 3 Paired Project
* Weeks 4 - 5 Group Project
* Week 6 Final Solo Project

## Final Technical Assessment

In Week 6, students will complete the Final Technical Assessment. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the this assessment, they will participate in the Final Retake Assessment. Students must pass **either** the final assessment or the retake to be promoted.


## Professional Development

In order to show readiness for Module 3, students are required to attend and engage in all Professional Development sessions in Module 2. They are required to setup and have at least one coffee chat with an industry professional and update their LinkedIn based on learnings in Mod 2 - both will be evident in Final Portfolio Presentation.

## Portfolio

Students will complete a portfolio, and participate in a portfolio review. Instructions for the portfolio can be found [here](../module1/requirements/portfolio_guidelines.md).
