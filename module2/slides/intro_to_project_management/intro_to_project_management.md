# Waterfall vs. Agile

* How would this apply to a project youâ€™ve completed here at Turing?
* How might this apply to a Sinatra project?

# Waffle

* Convert the requirements of the project to stories/issues on Waffle
* Let the stories drive development, even copy and paste the story into the tests
* Use waffle to track tasks to be completed
* Use waffle to keep you focused (i.e. avoid rabbit holes)
