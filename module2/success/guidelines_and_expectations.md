The learning at Turing extends beyond technical training. Equally as important is developing professional skills and creating an environment that encourages learning. As a precursor to a professional career as a Software Developer, we would like to emulate practices followed in a professional work environment. A professional work environment consists of a community of people. In addition to creating software developers, we want to simulate an industry we want to work in. We want to also concentrate on creating thoughtful, engaging developers, to add to the tech industry. Here are a few things that make a good community member at Turing:

-------

## Attendance

If you are unable to attend a day of instruction, let your instructors know as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to stay up-to-date on lessons that you miss. If you need anything or have questions, let both your anchor or supporting instructor know. They’ll be happy to help. When on group projects, be sure to let your group members know when you will be unavailable or absent.

#### Why?

Turing moves at an accelerated pace and missing classroom content can make topics more difficult to learn. Some classes are dependent on pairs and other preparation for the instructor. Letting them know ahead of time allows them to make necessary adjustments. For group projects, other members may be dependent on the work you are doing. There are also decisions being made when groups meet. If you can’t be present, try to utilize all resources (such as screenhero or hangouts) to help compensate for the potential gaps in communication. It will help your projects go much more smoothly.

-------

##  Tardiness

Class begins at 9am and after lunch at 1pm (always check the calendar for more detailed schedule information). Plan to be ready for instruction, in your classroom, BEFORE that time. If you are running late to class, let your instructors know.

#### Why?

This is a courtesy to your peers. Many students find late arrivals distracting and they interfere with learning. In some cases, classes are dependent on the number of students present and involve live coding. It is also possible to fall behind and miss learning goals when arriving late.

-------

## Group Participation

Active participation in both classroom instruction, community sessions, and group work is important. Engagement is a variety of things including: asking questions, participating in discussions, and actively listening.

#### Why?

Creating an open and inclusive community is important. The more that we can encourage active participation, the more perspectives there are to be heard. A variety of perspectives helps create the diversity Turing strives for. In the professional sense, having an opinion shows passion in that subject.

## Don’t just talk about it, be about it

Do you have ideas that would improve the environment at Turing? The Turing community is setup to adapt to change.  Ideas that are not expressed are ideas that don’t exist to everyone else. Weekly surveys will be provided to share jeers and cheers about your experience. Finding creative solutions for issues will be the best way to fix problems. Let us know if you think of ways to improve.

#### Why?

Part of an inclusive student body is the idea that this is everyone’s community. As the age old saying goes: Actions speak louder than words. Be empowered to be the change in this community.
