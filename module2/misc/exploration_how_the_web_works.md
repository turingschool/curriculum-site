### Additional Exploration

HTTP Status codes are used heavily in RESTful architecture. There are conventions around verb/resource and status codes that "should" be used. Find some resources online that specifically talk about RESTful routing and HTTP status codes.

Next, check one of your projects and see how well Rails or Sinatra manages those status codes for each of those 8 routes.
