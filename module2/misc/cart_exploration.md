title: Cart Exploration
---

### The goal of this exercise is to explore the idea of building a shopping cart in Rails.

This Exploration will require that you do a lot more independent (or group) research into the topic than previous explorations.

To get started, find and review some recent blog posts about "rails 5 shopping cart best practices".


###

Using the main code-along project in Mod 2 (ie, Set List, Bad Tracks, Jukebox, etc), implement tests and code that will satisfy the following user story:

```
As an unregistered user,
When I visit the song index
I see a link to “Add to Cart” next to each song.
When I click on “Add to Cart” on the first song
Then the resulting page shows a flash message saying “Added Song to Cart”
And I click a link on the page to "View Cart"
And I see a list of all songs I have added to my cart.
```

### You Cannot:
- Save cart to database

### You Can:
- Use Sessions

### BOSS MODE:
- extract cart to a Plain Old Ruby Object (PORO)
