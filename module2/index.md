## Overview  

In Module 2, students will be introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also continuing to expand upon fundamental Ruby skills by building database-backed full-featured web applications in Rails. Through group projects, we explore best practices in agile project management and collaboration. By the end of this module, students will be comfortable creating basic Rails web applications with dynamic front-end interfaces.
