## 3) Frontend

Now that we have all this coupon data, we can update our frontend to display some of it. On an individual merchant's page, display the following:


### 9. List of Coupons
Users can click on a merchant and see a list of all the coupons for that merchant.




### 10. Sort by Active and Inactive Coupons
Additionally, there should be a "Sort by Active" button that will sort the coupons by active and inactive.



### 11. Display a count of total coupons and total invoices with coupons applied
Above the list of coupons, display a count of total coupons and total invoices with coupons applied.
