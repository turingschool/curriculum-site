title: Hang In There - API
---

## Project Description



## Learning Goals

* Expose an API
* Use serializers to format JSON responses
* Test API exposure
* Use SQL and AR to gather data
* Breaking down a problem into small steps
* Practice individual research (articles, videos, mentors)

## Project Management

<!-- The organization of this project spec is by feature type. However, it is encouraged that you work through a little of each feature type rather than trying to complete an entire feature type before moving to the next. We encourage you to use an Agile approach as much as possible to complete this assignment, and to review the work and develop estimated milestones before you begin. **Any good set of milestones will allow for some slippage before the project is due.** -->

## Postman

<!-- We have adapted this project from previous cohorts and have rewritten a fully functional test suite right within Postman. By importing the JSON files noted below, you can open the Postman "Runner" and execute a large suite of tests.

**Note: not ALL of the Postman tests will be passing in order to pass the project**. You will need to examine the tests you NEED to run, since we're giving students some choice in how to build the application. -->



### Running one endpoint at a time

<!-- As you develop your endpoints, run `rails s` and find the appropriate endpoint within the Postman collection you imported. For example, "Get All Merchants". When you select "Get All Merchants" from the list, you should see a Postman tab open, pre-populated with everything you need to connect to the endpoint in your code and see if it works correctly.

Click the "Send" button in the top right corner.

In the lower portion of the Postman interface, you should see "Body", "Cookies", "Headers" and a spot that says something like "Test Results (7/7)". This would indicate that 7 tests passed out of 7. If you see, for example, 3/7 then 3 tests passed and 4 did not.

You can click on the "Test Results (7/7)" to see which tests passed.

The error messages aren't that great, but we're here to help you diagnose the problems. -->

<!-- **IMPORTANT** some of the endpoints include EDGE CASE testing, which should be saved as "extension" work. -->
