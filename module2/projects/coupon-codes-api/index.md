title: Coupon Codes API
---

This project is an extension of the Little Shop group project. You will add functionality for merchants to create coupons for their shop. 

## Learning Goals

* Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
* Implement CRUD functionality for a resource
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in serializers and controllers
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
* Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
* Write request tests that fully cover the functionality of the application

## Details

* This is a solo project, to be completed alone without assistance from cohortmates, alumni, mentors, rocks, etc.
* Must use Rails 7.1.x and Ruby 3.2.2. 
* Additional gems to be added to the project must have instructor approval.
  * RSpec, Pry, Simplecov, Shoulda-Matchers, Orderly, jsonapi-serializer (or other serializer gem), HTTParty, Faker, Faraday, and FactoryBot are pre-approved
* Scaffolding is not permitted on this project.

## Setup

This project is an extension of Little Shop. Students have two options for setup:

1. If your Little Shop project is complete, you can use it as a starting point for this project. If you are not the repo owner, fork the project to your account. If you are the repo owner, you can work off the repo without forking, just make sure your teammates have a chance to fork before pushing any commits to your repo.
1. If your Little Shop project is _not_ complete, fork **[this repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/little-shop-be-final-starter)** as a starting point for this project.

## Evaluation
Evaluation information for this project can be found [here](./evaluation).

## Functionality Overview

* A Coupon belongs to a Merchant
* An Invoice optionally belongs to a Coupon. An invoice may only have one coupon.
  * Note: When creating this new association on Invoice, your existing tests will fail unless the association is optional. Use these guides as a reference.
  * You are not required to build functionality for a user applying a coupon to an invoice, but can instead use test data, Rails console or seed data to add coupons to existing invoices to verify behavior.
* You should build full CRUD functionality for coupons with criteria/restrictions defined below:
   - A merchant can have a maximum of 5 activated coupons in the system at one time.
   - A merchant cannot delete a coupon, rather they can activate/deactivate them.
   - A Coupon has a name, unique code (e.g. "BOGO50"), and either percent-off or dollar-off value. The coupon's code must be unique in the whole database.
* If a coupon's dollar value (ex. "$10 off") exceeds the total cost of that merchant's items on the invoice, the grand total for that merchant's items should then be $0. (In other words, the merchant will never *owe* money to a customer.)
* A coupon code from a Merchant only applies to Items sold by that Merchant.

## 1) CRUD Endpoints

Below is the expected JSON response for each request. We have also outlined a few examples of Sad Paths you may consider adding in. In your project, you should take time to implement at least 2 sad paths total, but you are not limited to the examples we provide.

## Extensions

Students can pick one or more of these extension features to add to their project: 

1. On the Merchant Coupon Index page, active and inactive coupons are sorted in order of popularity, from most to least. 
2. Inactive coupons cannot be added to an Invoice. 
3. A Coupon has a maximum number of uses before it is automatically deactivated. When implemented, prove that the number of times used on the Merchant Coupon Show Page is updated accordingly. 
4. Generate unique coupon codes as suggestions when creating a new coupon.
