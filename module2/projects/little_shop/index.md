## Project Description

You are working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs. 

Your job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that a front end will consume. You will be working with an existing front end application that consumes these APIs, and part of your work will also be to make a few adjustments to that front end as well (see "Connecting to the Front End" below).

* Expose API endpoints to CRUD database resources
* Validate models and handle sad paths for invalid data input
* Test both happy and sad path functionality based on JSON contracts
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, lmiting data logic in controllers and serializers
* Track user stories with GitHub Projects
* Deploy your application to the internet (?)
* Improve an existing FE application by:
    * Styling the user interface
    * Refactoring JavaScript code
    * Adding an additional FE feature

## Project Management

Groups must utilize a project board in order to organize areas of work and allow for  visibility of each other's progress. In addition, groups will be evaluated on the evidence of meaningful code review, either via comments on a PR, or through discussion of live code review during their evaluation.
