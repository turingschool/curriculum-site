# Extensions & Extra Practice


## External API Consumption

<br>

<details><summary><h3>9. Get Item Images</h3></summary>

#### Details: 
1. The endpoint should be in the pattern of `GET /api/v1/items/:id`, to add onto the "Fetch a Single Record" endpoint (#2 above).
2. You will need to utilize the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for this - specifically, the [Search Photos](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos) endpoint. Supply a query that would work for this item's name, and use the API to retrieve an image to represent this item. 
3. If an invalid image id is passed in, a 404 status as well as a descriptive error message should be sent back in the response.
4. The `data` top level key should always point to an array even if one or zero images were found for this image. 
5. If no image is found, a link to a placeholder image URL can be used (see [placehold.co](https://placehold.co/)), using the `Text` option to include a URL-encoded string representing the Item's name in the placeholder image.
