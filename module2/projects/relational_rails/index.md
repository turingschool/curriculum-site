title: Relational Rails
---

## Learning Goals

* Design a one-to-many relationship using a schema designer.
* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
* Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources.
* Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers.
* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior.

## Requirements

- Must use Rails 7.1.x, Ruby 3.2.2
- Must use PostgreSQL
- Must "handroll" all routes (no use of `resources` syntax)
- Use of `scope` syntax is not permitted on this project
- Use of scaffolding syntax is not permitted on this project

## Permission

- If there is a specific gem you'd like to use in this project that is not mentioned on this project page, you must get permission from your instructors first.
  - Pre-approved gems are `rspec-rails, pry, capybara, orderly, launchy, simplecov, shoulda-matchers, factory_bot_rails, faker`

## Setup
Students should create their own new Rails app for this project. Students can reference the [Task Manager tutorial app](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task_manager_rails) for how to set up a new Rails project.

Students must host their code in a new repository on GitHub.

## Evaluation
[Peer code share](./peer_code_share), evaluation, and rubric information can be found [here](./evaluation).

## Relationships

### Design your database

Read [this lesson plan](https://curriculum.turing.edu/module2/lessons/one_to_many_relationships) and use it as a reference when designing your database.

Each student will come up with their own one-to-many relationship. This should represent a real world example of your choice. An example would be:
- Shelters and Pets
- A Shelter has many Pets
- A Pet belongs to one Shelter.

Do not use "Parent"/"Child" as your relationship.

These relationships are yours to create, but instructors are happy to provide feedback on the relationships if asked.

Use [This database design site](https://www.dbdesigner.net/) to design your database with your one-to-many relationships.

Here is an example diagram:

![Example Design](../../misc/images/adopt_dont_shop_db_design.png)

You can create as many columns on each table as you would like, but we need a few columns represented on each table:

1. One string column for a 'name'
2. One boolean column
3. One numeric column
4. Two DateTime columns: `created_at` and `updated_at`

A couple of things to keep in mind as you're designing your schema:

* Foreign Keys do not count as an integer column.
* You should not create columns that duplicate data. For example, in Pets/Shelters, a Shelter should not store a "pet_count" column since the count of Pets can also be found by counting the number of associated pets.

**Please send your instructors your chosen Parent/Child objects by Tuesday EOD.** We are happy to help you choose your objects if you like!

**Your schema and any model/feature testing will be reviewed as part of our first check-in.**

## User Stories

A user story is a concise description of functionality that a specific user should experience while using your application. In these stories, we will refer to the "one" side of the relationship as the "parent" and the "many" side of the relationship as the "children/child". In the Pets/Shelters example, Shelter would be the parent, and Pets would be the children.

Children can be associated to the Parent. Children belong to a parent. Anywhere you see `child_table_name` think `pets` from our Pets and Shelters example.

Each user story will focus on one of the following:

* __ActiveRecord__
* __CRUD Functionality__
* __Usability__: Users should be able to use the site easily. This means making sure there are links/buttons to reach all parts of the site and the styling/layout is sensible.

_Note_: When writing code for each user story, it is important to go in **numerical** order; don't jump around. You may notice some later user stories "overwriting" earlier stories - this is intentional and mimics what you may experience on the job when working with real clients.
