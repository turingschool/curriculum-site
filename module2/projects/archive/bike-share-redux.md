# Bike Share

This is a large-group project. The most common feedback we get from students is that they didn't get to work on a particular area of the project because of the size and complexity of the project. **You must advocate for yourself** if there's a particular area of the project where you would like to focus your attention.

## Abstract

In this project you'll use Ruby, Rails, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco and allows a user to purchase bike accessories via an online store.

In this project you'll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

This application will collect data in two ways:

1. Through web forms allowing users to enter trip/station/weather information
1. By consuming CSV files with historical information for stations, trips, and weather. In addition to creating and storing this information for viewing at a later date, this application will provide a number of user dashboards with higher level analysis of trends in bike share usage.

## Learning Goals

### ActiveRecord

* Use ActiveRecord migrations to create a normalized database
* Use intermediate ActiveRecord queries to calculate and report on information in the database
* Utilize ActiveRecord methods and relationships to efficiently query the database

### User Experience and Conventions

* Use Rails and ERB templates to render views to create, read, update, and delete resources using RESTful routes and appropriate HTTP verbs
* Use Rails and ERB templates to display a dashboard not related to a specific resource saved in the database
* Practice mixing HTML, SASS, and templates to create an inviting and usable User Interface
* Deploy an application to Heroku
* Write an articulate README documenting features and functionalities of application
* Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
* The application has been styled.
* The application uses a balanced, considered color scheme.
* The application implements a font which is not the default font.
* The application utilizes a nav bar.
* The style shows evidence of intentional layout.
* Space and text is balanced. White space is used to visually separate content.
* The application is easily usable. The user can intuitvely navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

### Code Organization/Quality

* Differentiate responsibilities between components of the Rails stack
* Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
* Organize code using best practices (use POROs when appropriate, avoid long methods, logic lives in appropriate places, etc.)
* Create methods using ActiveRecord on the appropriate class.

### Testing

* Use RSpec to drive development at the feature and model levels.

### Working Collaboratively

* Use Git and GitHub to work collaboratively, develop in smaller groups, and resolve merge conflicts.
* Use Git for code reviews with one another. (we want to see your conversation/questions)
* Practice an Agile workflow and improve communication skills working within a team.
* Seek technical feedback from peers and Product Owners utilizing Code Review on PRs.
* Use a Pull Request Template, as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/).

## Process

Each team will have an assigned Project Manager (peer) that will be the primary point of contact between the Product Owner (instructor) and the rest of the team.

All base stories will be provided by the Product Owner. You will be asked to write your own stories for Extensions and they should follow the same format as the ones that are provided to you.

You should not write code or migrations until a story calls for it.

Teams can self-pace but will have a number of stories required to be completed at each check-in. Full teams (not just the Project Manager) will meet with the Product Owner regularly and demo completed stories in production mode (hosted on Heroku, NOT on localhost). Project scope and requirements can change at the discretion of the Product Owner so following an Agile approach is really important.

It is expected that teams will have meaningful discussions and code reviews using comments on Github. If you would like technical feedback from instructors, you will need to tag them in PRs with specific questions. Commits should also have meaningful messages. Be careful about what type of commits are being made, i.e. "Cleanup Hound violations". If you want to learn more about squashing commits, see [here](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html).

It is also expected that teams will use a Pull Request Template, as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/).

The master branch of your project should always remain in a state where it can be demoed and deployed... yes, even days that you don't have any _planned_ meetings. This also means that your production application (on Heroku) should be ready to demo at any time. It is a good idea to push changes to production(Heroku) each time you merge to master.

Everyone will provide feedback for group members at the end of the project.

### Restrictions

Project implementation **MUST** use:

* `bcrypt` must be used for authentication

Project implementation may **NOT** use:

* (no restrictions)


### Getting Started

2. One team member creates a repository with the name of your online bike analysis/ordering platform
3. Add the other team members and your instructor(s) as collaborators
4. Add your project to [waffle.io](http://waffle.io) to write and track user stories
5. Create a Pull Request template
6. Add the [user stories](little_user_stories) to waffle.

### Define the Relationship with Your Group

* DTR with your group [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/dtr_guidelines_memo.md).
* One group member should fork that DTR gist and send a link of their forked gist to your instructors as soon as it's complete.

### Requirements

This project must use:

* [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
* [ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

You'll want to set up the [DatabaseCleaner](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner) gem in order to have a clean database each time you run tests. Follow the instructions for setting up the gem. Due to a bug in the most recent version of the gem, you'll need to use this line when you set the strategy in your test helper file:

```ruby
DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
```

### Deployment

This project must be deployed with a smaller data set on Heroku.

## Details for Seeding CSVs

Download the dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share). This will include all of the CSV files that you will be using in this project. Since these files are large, you will want to set up your .gitignore so that when you add these files to the /db/csv/ directory they will not be pushed up to GitHub. However, this also means that each of the members of your team will need to download these files independently. Please note that there are idiosyncracies in the data that are outlined in some detail [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share/discussion/23165). These may not be important to you at this moment, but this will be an important reference as you move through future iterations.

Update the seeds file in your /db directory and add the station.csv file to your /db/csv/ directory. When you run rake db:seed your development database should be populated with the information from the station.csv file. Your index should include a total of seventy stations.
