### B1  

_Lessons Add/Remove_
* Namespacing to move to B2  
 * M1 students don't have opportunities to apply this concept. It also seems to confuse their concept of what a module is when we teach it together with Mixins.   
* Remove ORM lesson from B1    
  * In moving the below lessons in to week 5, it was rather over loaded. When analyzing which classes could be shifted around  it seems that ORM is not a necessary concept to be taught in M1 especially since it is also covered in M2.   
* Added 4 Principles of OOP  
  * Fundamental OOP concept. This is an introductory course aimed at giving exposure to the terms and concepts.   
* Added Ruby Object Model  
  * Adding class back in. Good background information for students to be exposed to.  
* Added Stacks, Methods, Control Flow   
  * Adding class back in. Good background information for students to understand how a programming language is executed.  
* Added Number System  
  * Adding class back in. Good background information for students to be exposed to before they apply binary or hex in the future.  
* Added How Computer Works  
  * Addinc class back in. Good background information for students to be exposed to.  

_Shifting Schedule_ 
* Move Enumerables 1 class to wk 2 
  * In an effort to decrease density of content in wk1, moved to wk2.
* Move Boolean Logic to Wk3 
  * In an effort to decrease content in wk 5 moved to wk 1. 
  
 _CFU_

   * Aligning with wording used in other modules.
