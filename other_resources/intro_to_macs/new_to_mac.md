## Warm Up

Spend 2 minutes talking to a new nearby best friend and talk about what's most 
intimidating to you.


## Introduction

Transitioning to using a Mac is not as hard as you think it is or may be. Apple
has worked really hard to make their interface intuitive and easy to understand.

It's okay if you struggle at first. I grew up on PCs and I had gotten a job at 
Apple having never used one in the past. And honestly, it was pretty humbling.
I had been a person who grew up with computers and felt that I knew computers
and here I was on my first day having to ask someone how to print something. I
was sure they were going to fire me.

It takes a little bit of time, it takes a little bit of practice, and you'll 
get there.

## The Trackpad

The first place we are going to start is with the trackpad. You may notice that 
we don't have any buttons. How are we going to click or right click without any 
buttons? Well, Apple calls the track pad a multi-touch trackpad because you can 
use multiple fingers in order to do what you need to do.

Click - Press down on the trackpad with one finger. 

Right Click - Press down on the trackpad with two fingers.

Scrolling - take two fingers and move them up and down on the trackpad. You move
your fingers down to scroll up, and you move them up to scroll down. This may 
seem counter-intuitive from your mouse wheel on a PC, but it's designed to 
match how you scroll through things on your phone. A friend once said to me,
"You gotta scroll up to get down." I stopped speaking to them after they said 
that to me.

Back / Forwards - In your web browser, a two finger left and right, will make 
you go forwards or backwards in your web browser.

Zooming - In your web browser and some other apps, a pinching motion will let 
you zoom.

Mission Control - three finger swipe up, lets you see all windows.

See Desktop - three fingers swipe with your thumb.

## The Keyboard

The keyboard is intimidating. There's no Windows key, there's a control key, an
option key and a command key with a weird symbol. (It's called a looped square.)

The option key is similar to the Alt key on PCs and even though we do have a 
control key, the command key is generally the Mac equvialent to the Windows CTRL
key.

A lot of the keyboard shortcuts you'll use will be Command and a letter.

Copy - Command + C

Cut - Command + X

Paste - Command + V

Open New Browser Tab - Command + T

Switch Applications - Command + Tab. You can also continue to hold command and 
press tab to cycle forwards or keep holding command and press ` to cycle 
backwards. Release command when you've selected the app you want.

Quit Program - Command + Q

Close Window - Command + W

Hide Window - Command + H

A lot of these make sense because the letter is a clue to what it does.

## Spotlight

Spotlight is best accessed using the keyboard shortcut Command + Space

It is billed as a search function, you hit the shortcut and you start typing in 
what you are looking for and your computer helps you find it.  Its real power
is in how it can become an application launcher. It will also find your apps and 
let you launch them directly from Spotlight. You can open your apps faster than 
ever before.


## The Dock

Another way we can launch applications and see what applications are running 
is through what we call the dock. It's the thing that sits at the bottom of your 
screen. It serves a double purpose. First, it's a place where you can launch 
apps you use a lot, and like we said before, it is where we see what apps
are currently running. When we look at the dock, we see that there are some 
icons and there are some icons with these dots underneath. The dots signify that
this application is currently running.
