## Communication

- `#employment-round-one`: A channel for folks looking for their first job out of Turing
- `#employment-commons`: A channel for any alumni on the job search (could be their second, third, etc. job out of Turing)
- `#employment-salaries`: A channel for alumni to share transparency around their job hunt and offers
- `#events`: A channel for announcements around events in the Turing community, including opportunities to audit classes as alumni
