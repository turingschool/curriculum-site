## Create an ATS-ready Resume
An ATS, or applicant tracking system, is used by most companies to screen resumes. Each ATS system is different -- when creating your resume, think about your audience, both in terms of content and the process of submitting the resume. **It's always important to follow the directions for that specific company**, but here are a few key components to keep in mind when creating a resume that is optimized for ATS systems:

* Use a Word doc or a Google Doc (which can be downloaded as a Word doc) to use as your main copy. Not all ATS systems can read PDFs.
* Use a single column. 
* Compare your resume to the job description and pull out key words to highlight in your skills and experience. **An ATS system will not assume you have a skill unless you list it. If it's in the job description, add it to your skills.** [Learn more about how to approach ATS systems here](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems).

We strongly recommend using a summary if you do not have a lot of previous work experience. 

- [ ] Provides a brief description of the student's career change to software and how they will use their previous skillset with their new skillset
- [ ] If for a specific position, the summary is tailored accordingly (instead of discussing general interest in software, summary addresses interest in specific job/company)

### Skills
- [ ] Skills listed are technical. **Do not** include "soft skills" or professional skills here -- add them to your experience descriptions 
- [ ] Skills are grouped logically by type
- [ ] No grammatical or spelling errors
- [ ] Section for skills learning/interested in (optional)
- [ ] If for a specific position, skills are tailored accordingly
