### General Turing Community Norms

- We ask questions when we are confused or uncertain about our next steps. When possible, we post our questions in the public channel to maintain a record in case someone else has the same question later. 
- We consider our talking space by knowing when to make space in class and group settings, asking people for their opinions, and waiting until all voices are heard before making a decision.
- We acknowledge, celebrate, and invite our individual experiences, differences, and backgrounds into every interaction.
- We seek opportunities to uncover and understand our conscious and unconscious biases.
- We are clear, constructive and actionable with feedback.
- We listen attentively when someone else is talking.  We wait for others to finish before speaking ourselves. We show each other grace in this remote environment.  We apologize and make space for the other person to finish when we do interrupt.
- We are people first. We start our time together by remembering we are people, not just screens working on the same thing. 
- We help each other learn and respect that we all learn differently.  
- We build each other up. We are all in this together. Your win is my win.  
- We apologize when we have broken a norm, take accountability, and learn from our mistakes.
