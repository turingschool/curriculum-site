Try consuming the Propublica API to determine the members of the house for a given state. The [Lists of Members](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/#lists-of-members) documentation tells us how to retrieve this data.

#### Exercise - Make an API Call Using Postman

1. Sign up for an API key [here](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api)

2. Use Postman to make an API call to the [members endpoint](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/#lists-of-members)

---

#### Exercise - Make the Same API Call Using Faraday

Try to consume the same endpoint in a Ruby file using the Faraday gem.
