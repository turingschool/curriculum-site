---

For this assessment you will be complete a 3 hour independent challenge.

In this assessment you will:

* Consume multiple third party APIs
* Expose an API endpoint
* Build well tested features
* Demonstrate mastery of all parts of the Rails stack
* Demonstrate mastery of Ruby
* Commit every 15 minutes to track your progress (details below)

## Areas of Knowledge

The intent of this assessment is to demonstrate a solid working understanding of the following:

* Consuming an API
* Exposing an API
* Writing tests that adequately test business value
* Core concepts covered in the previous two Modules
* Demonstrate good code quality using encapsulation and abstraction

In addition, we expect you to:

* Be able to explain all lines of code in your project
* Be able to interpret and implement user stories in a Rails project
* Be able to use external resources in the problem solving process (ie: Google, Docs etc)

## Expectations

* As you work, you *should*:
  * Commit your code every 15 minutes.
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
* As you work, you *should not*:
  * Push your code until the end of the assessment
  * Copy code snippets
  * Review old projects for code implementations
  * Seek live support from individuals other than facilitators


#### Note about the commit expectation:

To better follow your progress over the 3 hours we expect that you commit every 15 minutes regardless of where you're at. Be sure to commit anything you may want to talk about later. For example: You get the first implementation working but want to refactor. If you don't commit the first implementation and don't finish the refactor there is no record of your initial solution.

## Evaluation Criteria
Students will be evaluated on 3 main criteria: feature completion, testing, and code quality. The scale is as follows.
1. Below Expectations
2. Approaching Expectations
3. Meets Expectations
4. Above Expectations

### Feature Completion

1. Incomplete/Not Functional
2. Functional, but does not match the expected return exactly
3. Functions as expected
4. Any additional above-and-beyond work which includes other aspects of the project, such as user auth

### Testing

1. No testing / TDD __OR__ significant portions of untested code
2. Testing, but is not robust to cover expected functionality __OR__ has failing tests
3. Robust testing to cover happy path functionality
4. Tests include sad path coverage

### Code Quality

1. Completes less than 3 checkboxes outlined below
2. Completes 3-4 checkboxes outlined below
3. Completes all checkboxes outlined below
4. Completes all checkboxes outlined below and implements inheritance or polymorphism

- [ ] API keys are not hardcoded
- [ ] Student demonstrates understanding of MVC principles
- [ ] Student demonstrates understanding of SRP
- [ ] Student demonstrates understanding of encapsulation
- [ ] Student demonstrates understanding of abstraction
