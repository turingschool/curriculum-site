# Abstraction & Encapsulation
---

## Learning Goals

* Explain abstraction and encapsulation

* Understand how to use classes and methods to make abstractions that improve code quality

* Understand how to  write code that demonstrates encapsulation of data

---

## Warm Up

* What is meant by Object-Oriented Programming?

* What are the 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming?

---

### Object-Oriented Programming
  - Developers conceptualize code as objects/containers
  - Objects (_aka classes in Ruby_) are able to store data and commands
    * Data = Attributes/Properties
    * Commands = Methods/Functions

---

### 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming
  - Easy way to remember __A PIE__
    * Abstraction
    * Polymorphism
    * Inheritance
    * Encapsulation

## Abstraction & Encapsulation

* Take 10 minutes to do some individual research
* As you research, I would like you to pay attention to:
  - What keywords are you using?
  - How do you determine if the resource you are using is good?
  - What type of resources do you find most helpful (docs, articles, tutorials, videos, etc.)
* Share a resource you found to be helpful in the Slack thread

---

## Abstraction

* Display only what is essential

* Hide away unnecessary complexity

---

## Encapsulation

* Bundle like data and functionality together

---

## Abstraction vs Encapsulation

* These terms can be hard to keep separated when talking about code
  - Both are 'hiding' code in a way
  - _Abstraction_ is hiding unessential code
  - _Encapsulation_ is hiding/grouping code to be stored in a container and limiting who has access to the container
