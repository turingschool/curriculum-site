title: Module 3 - Midmod Assessment
---

The midmod assessment is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts covered in the module so far. It also mimics the final assessment presentation format and thus is a great way to prepare for the final assessment.

For the midmod assessment, students will choose any project previously completed to present to an instructor. The midmod and final assessments are meant to mimic a tech challenge interview. In order to be considered a passing assessment, students need to perform at a level such that they would be advanced to the next step in an interview process.

We will use the take-home project rubric to evaluate the midmod assessment in order to ensure that students are practicing towards meeting the expectations of a passing assessment.

Midmod assessment presentations will be completed in small groups with an instructor. Observing the presentations of other students can be a great way to prepare for the final assessment by providing the opportunity to give and receive valuable feedback on how to improve the presentation.
