### Warm Up - TIPS - (15 Minutes)

Take seven minutes to research the history of JavaScript on the internet and make some notes in your notebook.

Take three minutes to talk about it with your new best friend.


### History of JavaScript

"Every programming language has its creation myth." -Steve Kinney

#### Ruby

The word that Matz uses when talking about the creation of Ruby is joy. "For me, the purpose of life is partly to have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can concentrate on the creative side of programming, so Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."

#### JavaScript

"JavaScript May Have Been Written in Ten Days, But Wait Till You Hear How Much Time We've Spent Fixing It."  -@BuzzfeedJS

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich, a Netscape employee in 1995. It was known then as Mocha, and essentially Eich was given ten days to write a whole new programming language, and it had to look like Java, which was the hotness at the time. (The two are actually unrelated).

And so, let us return and think on the lessons about empathy that we have learned during your last project.

You had a bit over ten days to do that project. Can you imagine writing an entire programming language in the same amount of time? What sins did you commit in Brownfield of Dreams? What sins do you think Eich committed in ten days?

Example. What number do we associate with the month January? 1? Not in JavaScript - it's zero. And knowing what we know about programming, one could say that it kind of makes sense that January would be zero. Buuuuu that's not how the real world works. 

"Working with JavaScript has traditionally involved memorizing a bunch of weird tricks and hacks."

An example of this is the dunder prototype. This was something added to let people know what prototype a thing came from, never expecting it to be a _thing_ and it was added. They then planned on taking out later as it got replaced with a better implementation, but when they went to do so, people freaked out because they were used to doing it in the old stopgap measure. So, right now, if you check the documentation for the dunder prototype, it says you shouldn't use it because it may get deprecated and removed at any point. No firm date or anything, just sometime soon. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next year. [Further Reading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto)
