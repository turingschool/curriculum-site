## Introduction

Working by yourself makes most people less likely to spend time organizing yet
you actually need it more. You don't want to get down deep into a rabbit hole
only to realize the project's due tomorrow and you're building a feature that
isn't needed.

In this session we'll work on planning out iterations of your project.

## Setup

### Checkpoints

First, let's establish the checkpoint dates for your project. It's due on a
Thursday. The Tuesday before that is a good time to target being feature-complete.
Back up to the previous Thursday and Tuesday for two others. Then back to the
Thursday and Tuesday of the first week. Six total checkpoints.

### Iterations

Then, for each date, plan an iteration that includes:

* A Title for this iteration
* A set of need-to-have bullet points
* A set of nice-to-have bullet points
* The Emergency Plan for what gets cut if you can't deliver on time

## Writing

Create a README in the root of your project and write out plans for each
of your six iterations.
