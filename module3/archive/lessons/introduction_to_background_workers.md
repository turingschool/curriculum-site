## Introduction to Background Workers

### Discussion - What are Background Workers

* Asynchrony overview
* Background processing as an intro to SOA -- 2 processes communicating via a Queue
* Any sufficiently complex program probably has a background / queueing mechanism

TODO -- probably should re-write this lesson in terms of sidekiq, since that's what
all our other lessons are using
