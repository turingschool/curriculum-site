layout: page
---

## Learning Goals

* Students are able to use classes and methods to make abstractions that improve code quality
* Students are able to write classes that demonstrate encapsulation of data
* Students are able to explain how their code achieves abstraction and encapsulation

## Part 1: Solo Research (10 minutes)

Research the following questions:

1. What is Abstraction?
1. What is Encapsulation?

## Part 2: Group Chart Paper (20 minutes)

As a group, create a chart paper with the following:

1. What is Abstraction?
1. Explain abstraction using a metaphor.
1. What is Encapsulation?
1. Explain encapsulation using a metaphor.

## Part 3: Paired Coding (30 minutes)

1. Clone down [Driving Simulator](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/driving_simulator).
1. With your partner, discuss some of the additions suggested in the README. **Note:** you should not actually implement the additions right now. Simply talk through them.
1. Discuss the questions in the README.
1. Finally, take some time to refactor the existing code.

## Checks for Understanding

* What is Abstraction? Why is it important?
* What is Encapsulation? Why is it important?
