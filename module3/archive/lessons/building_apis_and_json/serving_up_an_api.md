### Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will know/be able to:

* Utilize responders to serve data in multiple formats
* Utilize authentication within your API

### Structure

* 5  - Refresh about APIs and data
* 175 - Implement an API on storedom... Don't worry there will be pomodoros

### Discussion -- API vs Web App

Where is the real "value" in an average web app?
* Ultimately many web apps are just a layer on top of putting data
into a database and taking it out again
* APIs are a tool for exposing this data more directly than we do
in a typical (HTML) user interface
* What's differentiates an API from a UI -- Machine readability

## Build An API

First things first. Let's clone down another version of Storedom

```git clone -b building_api https://github.com/turingschool-examples/storedom.git building_api```
