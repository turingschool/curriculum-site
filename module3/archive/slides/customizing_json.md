# Warmup

Research ActiveModel Serializers

* What do serializers allow us to do?
* What resources were you able to find? Which seem most promising?
* What search terms did you use that gave the best results?

---

# About AMS

* Modifies `.as_json` (can check in `rails c`)
* Uses model syntax

---

# Scavenger Hunt

Based on the resources you found, how do you:

* set up AMS in your Rails project?
* create a new serializer?
* tell a serializer which attributes to display?
* tell a serializer to display related objects?
* tell a serializer to display a calculated value?
* specify a different serializer to use for a specific controller action?
