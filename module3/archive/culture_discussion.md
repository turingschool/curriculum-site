## Intro

The intent of this session is to continue building strong connections in the cohort and share different aspects of our lives that others may not be aware of with a goal toward building a strong and safe culture.

**Word of Caution:** Some might feel compelled to share personal information if their partner discloses something personal. Please don't share anything you aren't comfortable sharing. Let's also be careful not to turn this exercise into a competition.

## What is culture?

* Culture is our way of life. It includes our values, beliefs, customs, languages and traditions.
* Culture is learned and transmitted at the family, community, and national level.
* Culture is reflected in our history, in our heritage, and in how we express ideas and creativity.
* Our culture measures our quality of life, our vitality, and the health of our society.
* Through our culture we develop a sense of belonging, personal and cognitive growth, and the ability to empathize and relate to each other.
* An individual can simultaneously navigate many cultures and subcultures.
