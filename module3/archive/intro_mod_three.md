# Intro to Mod 3

## Introductions

Instructors will introduce themselves and share their story.

## Expectations

* Many of the lessons require setup in the beginning. If you're late, you miss this time and it becomes distracting to your classmates or you may miss the context for the lesson as you  you attempt to catch up, impacting how much you will be able to retain. There are less classes in Mod 3 and most will impact your projects significantly. Please be on time.
* Provide the [practice assessment](practice_assessment).

### Learn how to ask good questions.

Taken from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-ask-questions-as-a-junior-software-developer)

> Using your senior/junior vernacular, here is a response from a senior developer who has spent countless hours working with juniors (which I enjoy).
>
> 1. Don't be afraid to ask for help, no one knows everything and we were all a junior when we started.
> 2. First, try Rubber Ducking
> 3. Don't forget about Stack Overflow
> 4. If that doesn't work, make sure you ask informed questions.  Even without an answer, understand the problem you're trying to solve and make sure you're able to communicate it.
"how much time" - Are you on a deadline?  Are customers being impacted?  It really depends.  Time learning is not a waste, so take as much as you possibly can.  If there is contention on the senior's time, pair up with some other junior's and see if you can solve the problem together.
> 5. If the seniors don't spend a lot of time with the junior's in your organization, or are not approachable, consider that a warning sign.  You want to work for a company that values continual improvement and knowledge sharing.
> 6. I am a fan of pair programming, give it a try if you haven't already.  You may find that its a path to accelerated learning and better software.


One thing I'd add is for number 2 ([Rubber Ducking](http://wiki.c2.com/?RubberDucking)) on the list, writing out your question can serve a similar purpose. Using Slack can be great because other students can benefit from reading through the discussion.

Be mindful not to post something like "I'm trying to build X but it's not working." A more informed question will involve what you tried and what leads you to believe it's not working. Do you have an error message? Share it. What have you tried? Are you following a tutorial or using a specific gem? The more specific your question the more likely you are to receive a response. The other magical thing that tends to happen is that sometimes the process of breaking it down in a way that someone else can understand will be enough for you to solve the problem before needing to ask.

The best developers ask informed questions. How well do you execute [Stack Overflow's](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) suggestions when you are asking questions?
