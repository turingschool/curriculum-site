## Check-ins and Milestones

The scope of this project is more fluid than prior projects and will in large part be determined by meetings with your client. We want you to be able to discuss your app with non-technical parties as well as technical.

### 1st Check-in

#### What should be done

Your client will want to go over your plan for the project. Bring wireframes and detailed user stories (i.e. waffle cards). Don't underestimate the value of a good plan.

(You should also have a rough schema sketched out, but you will not be reviewing this with your client.)

#### What to expect from your client

Clients will help you refine your plan, including scope, wireframes and project management. You'll also decide what should be done by the next check-in.

### 2nd Check-in

#### What should be done

This is based on what you decided in your last check-in and should be working **in production**. You should be well on your way to basic functionality. If you've changed the plan, be sure to let your client know prior to the check-in. Have a plan for what you'd like to go over.

#### What to expect from instructors

Your client will review the work you've done so far at a high level. Then it's really up to you what to look at. Get feedback on your code, even the parts you know need to be refactored. These are great moments to make changes in a way that will save you time in the long run.

You'll also decide what should be done by the next check-in.

### 3rd Check-in

#### What should be done

Last check-in before evaluation.

This is based on what you decided in your last check-in, but basic functionality should be completed. If you've changed the plan, be sure to let your instructor know prior to the check-in. Have a plan for what you'd like to go over.

#### What to expect from instructors

Your client will review the work you've done so far at a high level. Then it's up to you what to look at.

By this point, you should be near done with basic functionality, and ready to talk about extensions for your app.
