## Working with Git

Once you have written the user stories with your client, each team member should:

1.  Select a story from the project management tool.
1.  If the story is not clear, add comments or request clarification.
1.  Create a feature branch in your *local* repo.
1.  Write a feature test.
1.  Implement the requested feature.
1.  Merge the latest master into the requested feature to make sure that all
the tests are passing.
1.  Commit referencing the issue that you are working on in the commit message. Check this [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) for more information.
1.  Push the *feature* branch to the *remote* repo.
1.  Submit a pull request asking to merge the branch into *master*.
1.  A teammate reviews the code for quality and functionality.
1.  The teammate merges the pull request and deletes the remote branch.
