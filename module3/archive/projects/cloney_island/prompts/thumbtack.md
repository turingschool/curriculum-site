## Professional Finder (Thumbtack)

You need things done like new siding on your house or a vintage couch reupholstered. New business owners and side tinkerers want more work.
Let's create a platform that connects professionals to projects in a way that encourages people to stay honest.

### Specific Requirements

* User roles should include: guest, professional, requester, admin.
* Professionals should be able to publicly post profiles of their skills.
* Requesters should be able to publicly post work they need done on their property.
* Both professionals and requesters should be able to message each other to discuss the project including sending images of the work that needs to be done and PDFs of estimates.
* Once a project is assigned to a professional, it should no longer be listed publicly.
* Requesters should be able to see all projects they've listed.
* Professionals should be able to see all work they've applied for (with differentiation for projects they've been assigned to).
* To keep both professionals and requesters honest, each can rate each other. (polymorhic association)
* Only professionals can see a requester's rating.
* Professionals should only see requests for jobs they have the skills to complete. (i.e. A seamstress probably shouldn't see a request for siding)

### Possible Extensions

* Integrate a 3rd party API for online payments.
