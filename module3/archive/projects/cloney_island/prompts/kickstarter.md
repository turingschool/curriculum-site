## Crowdfunding (Kickstarter)

Users have ideas and dreams but need funding to make them happen. Allow them to upload a pitch and users can pledge a set amount to help reach a funding goal.

* User roles include: guest, registered, project owners, project funders, admin
* Guests can view projects
* Registered users can start projects
* A project can have more than one user as owners/requesters
* Registered users can fund projects
* A progress bar that shows what percentage funding is at

### Possible Extensions

* Limited tiers for funding amounts with different incentives/rewards
* Video uploading
