## Couch Surfing (Airbnb)

Traveling somewhere but don't feel like getting a hotel room? Let's create a
platform that allows you to find couches in the area that you can book, or post
your couch for someone else to crash on.

### Specific Requirements

* User roles should include: guest, traveler, host, admin.
* Travelers and hosts should be able to publicly post profiles describing themselves.
* Hosts should be able to publicly post information about room they have available.
* Both travelers and hosts should be able to message each other to discuss a reservation.
* Once a reservation is confirmed, it should no longer be listed as available for those dates.
* Travelers and hosts should be able to see all reservations they've applied for (with differentiation for those confirmed).

### Possible Extensions

* Users can "vouch" for each other, upping their credibility across the site.
