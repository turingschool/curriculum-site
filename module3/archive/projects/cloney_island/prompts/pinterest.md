## Pinspiration (Pinterest)

Need a new recipe? Maybe some ideas on what to wear to work? What color should
you paint your bedroom? Let's create a platform that allows you to keep
all of your inspiration in one place.

### Specific Requirements

* User roles should include: guest, registered user, admin.
* Guests and registered users should be able to browse public pin boards.
* Registered users should be able to post to either public or private boards they manage.
* Private boards can be shared with specific users.
* Registered users should be able to follow each other.
* Registered users can comment on pins.
* Registered users should see a dashboard on login with chronologically listed updates from those they follow.

### Possible Extensions

* Build a Chrome extension that makes images and links on the web "pinnable."
