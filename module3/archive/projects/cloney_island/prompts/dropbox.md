## Filesharing (Dropbox)

Share all those files you have with your friends, families and co-workers. Let's
create a platform that allows users to share files and view/download files that
others share with them.

### Specific Requirements

* User roles should include: guest, registered user, admin.
* Guests can only browse publicly available files.
* Registered users can create public or private folders that they can upload files to.
* Registered users can invite other users to contribute to public or private folders.
* Users should be able to download zipfiles of content they have acccess to.

### Possible Extensions

* Registered users can request access to other users' private data.
* Set up breadcrumb pathing for easier navigation and shareable links (`/user/folder/inner_folder/airhorn.wav`).
