## Photosharing (Flickr)

The year is 2001. You have photos you want to share with the world. Maybe some photos
you don't want to share with your mom, but want to share with your friends?
Let's create a platform that allows users to share photos with certain groups of
people or share some for public consumption.

### Specific Requirements

* User roles should include: guest, registered user, admin.
* Guests can only browse publicly available photos.
* Registered users can create public or private buckets that they can upload photos to.
* Registered users can invite other users to upload to public or private buckets.
* Users should be able to download zipfiles of single images or entire buckets they have access to.

### Possible Extensions

* Create slideshow pages from users' photo buckets.
* Users can resize images before downloading.
