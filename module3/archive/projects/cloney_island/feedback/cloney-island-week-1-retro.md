# The Cloney Island Re-DTR

This is the true story... of three (or four) students... picked to clone a large production app...work together and have their work evaluated... to find out what happens... when people stop being polite... and start getting real...The Re-DTR.

You've been working on your project for one week. You've been working with new team members, and most of you are working with a new codebase. You've probably had good experiences and bad experiences. Take a break from execution to talk about your experiences.

## Goal

- Discover strengths and weaknesses of your group and each other
- Revisit your DTR to make your group more effective

## Activity

### Whole Cohort

#### Sandwich

Everyone will have the opportunity to talk about their experience with the Cloney Island so far. Say something you've liked, something you haven't liked, and something you've liked.

The project, code, teammates, instructors, and anything else about your experience is fair game.

### Cloney Island Groups

#### Get started

Take a minute to review the DTR you did on Monday

#### Mini-fishbowl üêü

Start by setting a random order by putting all your names in a hat, and drawing them out.

1. Each member of the team will give feedback to the person in the hotseat (the hotseater).
2. The hotseater is not allowed to respond until other members of the team have spoken
3. The hotseater can respond after the rest of the team has spoken

#### Update your DTR

What did you learn? What are you going to change? How is your team going to be better for the second week of The Cloney Island?

Revisit your DTR from Monday, and update it based on your feedback and conversations
