### Individual

Provide feedback for your Cloney Island team members. For each member please provide one glow and one grow.

#### Principles for providing valuable feedback

Your feedback should be guided by these 3 principles:

* Specific - General feedback like “you did good work in this project” is not helpful for the recipient. Specificities allow for people to hear exactly what they could improve in without any guesswork on their part. A more helpful example is something like this: “You did a good job with authentication because you remembered to cover all of the cases with both regular uses and admins, but you didn’t test for all of the edge cases in order to make sure we have good coverage.”
* Actionable - Similar to why feedback should be specific, feedback should be actionable so that recipients can make a concrete plan on how to improve. Example: “You did a good job with the last feature because you really were very communicative in your pull request, but you could really stick to the style guide in order to make sure all of our code is uniform.” The action step here is provided for the recipient here -- using the style guide -- in order to create uniform code in the next project.
* Kind - Hearing critiques of your work is hard! We all know that we need to improve, but hearing those critiques in a harsh way puts us on the defensive and could cause us to disregard the feedback, no matter how actionable and specific it might be. Giving feedback from a kind place ensures that everyone feels safe and supported.

Putting this into practice:

Use a template like this: “You did a good job with ____________ because _______________, but you could ____________________ in order to _______________________.”
