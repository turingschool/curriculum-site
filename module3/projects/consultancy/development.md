We will be using a (somewhat) Agile process during the development of this project. This will include:

* Working in short 3 or 4 day "Sprints"
* Using GitHub
* Using a project management tool such as Github Projects
* Conducting Story Refinement meetings
* Doing daily check-ins
* Demoing your project to your Project Manager
* Holding Team Retros

Note: Additional non standard gems must be approved by your project manager.


## Sprints

In Agile processes, a sprint is a single cycle of development. The most common length of a sprint is two weeks. During this cycle, teams will assign features, develop those features, demo their work, get feedback, and retro.

### Sprint Breakdowns

Days/times are subject to change due to holidays.

#### Sprint 0: Inception

- Begin: Monday of Week 4
- End: Thursday AM of Week 4
- Deliverables are listed on the [Inception page](./inception)


#### Sprint 1: Development

- Begin: Thursday of Week 4
- End: Monday morning of Week 5
- Example Sprint Goals:
  - Back-end API endpoints largely complete
  - Skeleton front-end structure built with mock data
  - External API integration complete

#### Sprint 2: Development

- Begin: Monday Afternoon Week 5
- End: Thursday Afternoon Week 5
- Example Sprint Goals:
  - Professional-looking front-end
  - MVP for each component is met
  - FE is consuming BE API endpoints, not mock data

#### Sprint 3: Finishing Touches or Code Freeze

- Begin: Thursday Evening Week 5
- End: Saturday Evening Week 5
- **What's a code freeze?**
  - New features/functionality are not added (unless totally necessary)
  - Time dedicated instead to: debugging, enhanced testing, error handling, presentation preparation, documentation, deployment fixes

### Project Check In Schedule

* Check In 1
    * Wednesday or Thursday of Week 4
    * During this meeting, you should be prepared to review the artifacts from your inception
    * During this meeting, your team will draw out the architecture of your application and all should be ready to speak to it

* Check In 2
    * Monday Week 5
    * During this check in, you will discuss any adjustments you might need to make to your MVP
    * Review retro notes with your PM
    * You can also use this check in as an opportunity to ask any questions and get help for the final few week of the project.

* Check In 3
    * Review of near-final work, check for MVP
    * Ask questions, discuss blockers
    * Review 2nd retro notes
    * Discuss presentation details

### Development Reminders

#### Git/GitHub

* Commit Frequently
* Decide on a [git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
* Make branches and submit Pull Requests for each new feature.
    * DO NOT commit directly to main
    * Keep your PRs as small as possible (one feature / user story per PR)
    * Use screenshots and screencasts to demonstrate functionality.
    * Your PR should be reviewed by at least one team member before it is merged.
    * Tag your Project Manager if you have questions. DM your Project Manager letting them know you have tagged them.


#### Story Refinement

* You should be using a project management tool to keep track of your stories.
* At a minimum, the beginning of every sprint should include a "Story Refinement" meeting
* When doing a "Story Refinement" you should:
    * Make sure that the project board is up to date
    * Look over the current backlog of stories and decide if you want to make any changes
        * Are there any stories that need to be updated, or require more details in the story card?
        * Are these stories detailed enough that any team member could pick it up and work on it with a common vision?
        * Are there any stories that need to be added?
    * Assign stories to individual team members or pairs
        * Be clear on what it is that everyone should be doing
* You may need to call additional refinement meetings during a sprint.

#### Daily Check-Ins

* A "daily" (also known as a "stand up") is a very brief meeting for the development team to keep in touch about what everyone is doing.
* During the daily check-in, each member of the team will take 1 - 2 minutes to answer these questions:
    * What have you been working on?
    * What are you going to be working on?
    * Is anything blocking you?
* Every weekday you should send your PM a summary of the day's daily check-in.

#### Retros

* Your team should have at least 2 retros during the course of the project. 
* One will be scheduled on the calendar for you, and the other you will need to schedule as a team
* Consult the [Retro Guide](./retro_guide) for more details
