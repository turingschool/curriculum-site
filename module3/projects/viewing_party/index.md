## Project Description

For this project, you will be building an application to explore movies and create a viewing party event for you and your friends to watch a movie together. The application will require basic authentication.

## Learning Goals

### Explicit
Below are technical goals that you should be applying in this project.<br>
The priority of these goals are demonstrated using a star grading system.<br>
By the end of this project: <br>
  Student should have a functional understanding of the concept ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ <br>
  Student should have a familiar understanding, but may still have questions ⭐ ⭐ <br>
  Student should know of the concept, but need further resources to implement ⭐

* Consume JSON APIs that require authentication ⭐ ⭐ ⭐
* Build an application that requires basic authentication ⭐ ⭐ ⭐
* Organize and refactor code to be more maintainable ⭐ ⭐  
* Implement a self-referential relationship in ActiveRecord ⭐ ⭐
* Apply RuboCop's style guide for code quality ⭐
* Utilize Continuous Integration using Travis CI ⭐


_Note: See [Learning Goals](../../misc/learning_goals) to see at what level these skills need to be by the final._

### Implicit
Below are skills that are more general/necessary on the job that are practiced by completing the goals above.

## Evaluation
For the project evaluation each project team should prepare a 15 minute  presentation that covers the following points:

 - Demonstration of functionality  
 - Technical quality and organization of the code
 - Identifying code that should be refactored and how it would be refactored
 - Discussion of test coverage (happy and sad path and edge cases)

All team members are expected to participate equally in the presentation. Students should focus on practicing technical communication that is succinct and utilizes appropriate technical vocabulary.

Instructors will ask followup questions based on the presentation and rubric. All team members should be prepared to answer questions based on any of the above points.

Slides are not required, but encouraged as a way to facilitate the presentation along with sharing specific code examples.

Your project will be evaluated based on [this rubric](./rubric).
