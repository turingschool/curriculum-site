You will be given a code review partner. Exchange links for the repo and then independently walk through the sections below. You should answer the review questions from each section in a notebook or in a gist. Once both partners have completed the review of **all** sections, meet with your partner to discuss the feedback from notes you've taken. *Remember that feedback should be actionable and kind.*

### Setup

First,

* Clone down your partner's project
* Set up your partner's project

Then, answer the following questions:

* Was your partner's project easy to set up? Why or why not?
* Do they have a clear README? What sort of things should be included to make the set up more clear?

### Rake Task

First,

* Run your partner's rake task
* Open up the rake task and look it over.

Then, answer the following questions:

* Does the rake task work? How do you know?
* Is the rake task readable? Is it DRY? What are some improvements you could make to the rake task?

### Endpoints

First,

* Run the spec harness in Rails Driver against your partner's app
* Look through the code

Then, answer the following questions:

* How many endpoints failed the spec harness? Why did they fail?
