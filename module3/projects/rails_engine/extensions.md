Once your Rails Engine project is complete, you may choose any of the following extensions for additional points:

- Complete all of the find_one/find_all endpoints
- Complete all of the Non-RESTful business intelligence endpoints
- Add some business intelligence endpoints of your own
- Complete all of the "edge cases" tests and see if you can get the entire test suite to pass!
