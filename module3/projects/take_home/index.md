title: Mock Take-Home Challenge
layout: page
---
<!-- At its core, the Take Home Challenge is a professional development project. Technically speaking, this probaby won't present many new things you haven't seen before. This is an opportunity to practice planning, documentation, decision making, and then speaking about those topics to an interviewer. -->


Your final project is a Take-Home Challenge meant to simulate a task that you might receive during an interview process. The scope is smaller scale and more open ended than other projects you've been assigned. The goal is to complete each part in 8 hours or less for a total of 16 hours or fewer over the course of 2 days. Since there is a time limit and due to the tasks' open ended nature, you should manage your time and plan appropriately. Not only is completing the take-home necessary, but also explaining your process and reasoning behind your decisions are equally important. Use this challenge to practice speaking about your planning and decision making processes around the code you write.

Completion and passing the Take Home Presentation is a promotion requirement. When you present, you should speak as though your assessing instructor is your potential employer. **If you would not be passed on to the next stage of the interview process based on your code and presentation, you will not pass this challenge.**

_As you are working, if you have questions, please reach out to your instructors as if they are a potential employer. This is a great opportunity for you to practice your written communication too._
