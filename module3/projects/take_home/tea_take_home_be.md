## Things we'll be looking for:

- A strong understanding of Rails
- Ability to create restful routes
- Demonstration of well-organized code, following OOP
- Test Driven Development
- Clear documentation

Try to limit your total time to approximately 8 hours on this portion of the project. Prioritize what is important to completing MVP and demonstrating your capabilities as a developer.


## Tea Subscription Service

You will create a Rails API for a Tea Subscription Service.

### Requirements:

At a minimum, you must create:

- An endpoint to subscribe a customer to a tea subscription
- An endpoint to cancel a customer's tea subscription
- An endpoint to see all of a customer's subsciptions (active and cancelled)

Beyond the base requirements, include any additional endpoints you'd like, but be mindful of your time. You don't need to go overboard, consider what might be necessary to achieve MVP so that this API is easy to understand and consume by a Frontend Developer.

 _If you are looking for a stretch option, you can consume this API for tea product information: [Spoontacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs)_
