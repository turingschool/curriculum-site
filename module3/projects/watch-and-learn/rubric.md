- **4:** Team can demonstrate how API consumption portions of the project demonstrate all of the four pillars listed below and RuboCop has no complaints.
- **3:** Team can demonstrate how API consumption portions of the project demonstrate 2 of pillars listed below, and RuboCop complains about 3 or less violations.
- **2:** Team can demonstrate how API consumption portions of the project demonstrate 2 of pillars listed below, and RuboCop complains about 4 or less violations.
- **1:** Team can demonstrate how API consumption portions of the project demonstrate 1 of the pillars listed below, or RuboCop complains about 5 or more violations.
