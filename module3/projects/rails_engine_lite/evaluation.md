length: 1 week
type: project

_[Back to Rails Engine Lite Home](./index)_

## Presentation
For the project evaluation, each project team should prepare a **10 minute video presentation**. Presentations longer than 10 minutes will not be reviewed and sent back for revision. Your presentation should cover the following points:

* Demonstration of functionality via Postman suites
* Technical quality and organization of the code, identifying code that should be refactored and how it would be refactored
* Running your application's test suite and a discussion of test coverage (happy/sad paths and any edge cases)
* Identifying the area(s) of code of which you are most proud, and an area where you would like specific feedback

_All_ team members are expected to participate equally in the presentation. Students should focus on practicing technical communication that is succinct and utilizes appropriate technical vocabulary.

Slides are not required, but encouraged as a way to facilitate the presentation along with sharing specific code examples.

Instructors will review the video presentation and do a brief code review (so please make sure you identify an area you’d like feedback in your video, so we can focus where you’d like it most). Scores and final comments will be sent to teams via Slack.
