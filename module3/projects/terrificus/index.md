## Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a successful web application from a project idea. You will create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

## Learning Goals

* Learning how to build a full Rails app from idea to delivery
* Revisiting previous concepts such as APIs and OAuth
* Finding the strengths and gaps in your knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and organizing
a project.
* Use an agile process as you develop features
* Configure a continuous integration server

## Technical Expectations

* Use an external OAuth provider to authenticate users
* Consume an external API
* Utilize a service-oriented architecture with at least one Sinatra Microservice
* Implement a production quality user interface
* Optimize your application using at least one of the following: database indexing, eager loading, caching, background workers, or AJAX requests

## Phases

* [Ideation](./ideation)
* [Inception](./inception)
* [Development](./development)
* [Retro](../retro_guide)
* [Evaluation](./evaluation)
