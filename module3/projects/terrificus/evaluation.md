### Technical Quality

* **4:**  Project demonstrates extractions that are above and beyond and might include SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) or takes on a new technology that outside the scope of the curriculum and includes all below expectations.
* **3:**  Project uses abstraction in ways that make it easy to change (example: if an API changes, Propublica to Google Civic, we make changes in as few places as possible). Project shows a solid understanding of MVC principles (this may include but is not limited to: no logic in views, clean controllers, serializers and presenters to handle formatting rather than models etc.) and includes all below expectations.
* **2:**  MVC is overall good but might have logic or hashes in views, formatting in models, or controllers with complex logic and includes all below expectations.
* **1:**  Project has significant gaps in understanding of MVC and with several examples of logic or hashes in view, controllers remain un-refactored, and models are used for formatting.

* **3:** Project achieves 90% or greater test coverage. In addition to "happy path", project also includes "sad path"/edge case testing.
