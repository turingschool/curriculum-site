## Evaluation

To submit this project, you will submit a video presentation of your project. You can use whatever tool you'd like, but we recommend Loom as a solid, free option. 

<!-- In Mod 3, instructors grade your projects asynchronously, providing thorough notes and feedback, which you will receive before our project evals. During project evals, you will begin building skills of talking about your code and answering technical interview questions through the context of the project.

### Minimum Collaboration and Professionalism Expectations
* Team holds daily standups throughout project.
* Commits are atomic and frequent, effectively documenting the evolution/progression of the application. There is no more than a 10% disparity in project contributions between teammates.
* A project board is utilized (and updated throughout the project) with Github issues and labels.
* Team members use branches/PRs and do consistent, thorough, meaningful code reviews of PRs, which prompt updates and changes made to that PR before merging
* The README is formatted well and at a minimum contains:
  * Overview of project and goals
  * Overview of technologies used, challenges, wins, and any other reflections
  * Link to deployed site
  * Screenshots/gifs of your app
  * Links to contributors' GitHub profiless
* When the project is run locally, the terminal shows no errors or warnings
* **Team collaborates effectively to accomplish the shared goal.  Team productively and professionally works through challenges and conflicts to ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.**  
* Instructors are available to offer support and guidance but conversations around what *is* and what *is not* working are expected to be led by the team members themselves.

## Rubric

For the rubric sections below, you will be scored as **Wow, Yes or Not Yet** depending on whether you have demonstrated competency in that area. Each section lists examples of what types of things we may be looking for as demonstrations of competency. Just as there are many ways to approach code, there are many many ways to demonstrate competency. These are just *some* examples.

<section class="answer">
### Does the project demonstrate student understanding of the learning goals & concepts?

Projects will answer that question, being marked as yes, not yet, and wow. Similarly, each section of the rubric (see below) will have yes/not yet/wow markings, helping you understand your progress and growth in specific areas.

The overall project outcome (yes, not yet, wow) is determined by “averaging” each section’s outcome. You can think of a “yes” being worth a 1, a “not yet” being worth a 0, and a “wow” being worth a 2.

For this project, an average of 0.5 is considered a yes - a passing project that demonstrates good student understanding! An average of 1+ is considered a wow. Anything below a 0.5 is considered a not yet - a project that indicates that the concepts have not been fully understood (see note in the section below). 
</section>

 In addition to any WOW examples listed below, you can strive for a WOW by demonstrating not just competency, but excellence and thoroughness across the rubric sections.

### React Fundamentals/UI

On track can look like:
  - A consistent, modular file structure is used
  - Create reusable and modular functional components by incorporating props and considering component composition
  - Hooks are implemented to manage and update state. State remains pure and immutable.
  - Data and functions are passed as props (only as needed) to effectively organize the application
  - Logic is pulled out of return statements when it makes sense.  `return` statements are as readable as possible, only communicating what will be displayed
  - Frontend state matches the backend data
  - Props are protected via Proptypes or type-checking
  - Code is DRY, reusable, and empathetic 
  - Application properly uses a catch block for network request error handling (if the server is down or if a fetch call fails) and displays helpful information to the user.

WOW can look like:
  - Application is deployed (to Vercel or similar service)
  - Data retrieved from a server is run through a cleaning function to handle any missing/inconsistent data and remove any extraneous data that isn't using in the application - before setting that data to state.
  - Application shows loading state
  - Application design is [responsive](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-3/css-responsive-layouts.html) across small, medium and large breakpoints
  
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Testing

On track can look like:
  - Application views are thoroughly tested
  - Application user flows are thoroughly tested
  - Tests make specific assertions about the content DOM elements contain
  - Network requests are properly stubbed (intercepted)
  - Happy path async functionality is stubbed and tested

WOW can look like:
  - Sad path async functionality is stubbed and tested
  - Implements Cypress `alias` and `wait()` 
  - Implements Cypress `fixture` 
  - Implements Cypress `command` 
  
</section>

<section class="answer">
### Routing

On track can look like:
  - Application uses Router to display appropriate components based on URL
  - The user has access to previous routes via the back/forward buttons
  - A 404 page handles unknown routes.  *You can check this by going to localhost:3000/nonsense*
  - Code was refactored to remove unnecessary or old code artifacts
</section>

### Collaboration and Professionalism 
- See "Minimum Collaboration and Professionalism Expectations" above.  
- While this is not a scored rubric section, every team member is expected to fully participate, contribute, communicate and collaborate with the team throughout the entirety of this project. **Failure to do so can result in an individual failing the project, even if the group/project is otherwise passing**.  -->
