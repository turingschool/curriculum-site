_[Back to Market Money Home](./index)_
# 1. Setup

1. Create a Rails API project called `market_money` (make sure you do not set up a "traditional" Rails project with a frontend, this is an API-only project): `rails new market_money -T -d postgresql --api`

2. Set Up [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to track test coverage in your rails-engine API project.

3. Download [market_money_development.pgdump](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/market_money_project/module3/projects/market_money/market_money_development.pgdump) and move it into the `/db/` folder in another folder called `/data/`, so your project files look like this:

```
/app
/bin
/config
/db
  /data # <-- create this folder
    market_money_development.pgdump # <-- put the .pgdump file in the data folder
  seeds.rb  # <-- seeds.rb is in `/db/` folder, not `/db/data/`
/lib
/log
etc
```

  - Note that this file is in a **binary format** and your browser may try to automatically download the file instead of viewing it. Also, opening this file in VSCode directly will produce a warning, and a lot of garbled text. It is NOT meant to be human-readable. 


4. Set up your `db/seeds.rb` file with the following content:
```ruby
cmd = "pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U $(whoami) -d market_money_development db/data/market_money_development.pgdump"
puts "Loading PostgreSQL Data dump into local database with command:"
puts cmd
system(cmd)
```

5. Run `rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}` and you may see lots of output including some warnings/errors from `pg_restore` that you can ignore. If you're unsure about the errors you're seeing, ask an instructor.

6. Run `rails db:schema:dump` . Then, check to see that your `schema.rb` exists and has the proper tables/attributes that match the data in Postico. You can do the following to check to see if you have set up rails to effectively communicate with the database.
  * Add a `market.rb` file to your models directory
  * Create a `Market` class that inherits from `ApplicationRecord`
  * run `rails c` to jump into your rails console.
  * run `Market.first` to see the object: `##<Market id: 322458, name: "14&U Farmers' Market", street: "1400 U Street NW ", city: "Washington", county: "District of Columbia", state: "District of Columbia", zip: "20009", lat: "38.9169984", lon: "-77.0320505">`
  * run `Market.last` to see the object: `#<Market id: 331081, name: "Year-Round Cedar City Farmer's Market ", street: "905 South Main Street at IFA", city: "Cedar City", county: nil, state: "Utah", zip: "84720", lat: "37.6619", lon: "-113.069">`
  * If this all checks out you should be good to go.

7. Use a tool like Postico to examine the 3 tables that were created. Pay careful attention to the data types of each field:
  * markets
  * vendors 
  * market_vendors


**NOTE** If your `rails new ...` project name from above is NOT exactly called "market_money" you will need to modify the `cmd` variable to change the `-d` parameter from `market_money_development` to `<YOUR PROJECT NAME>_development` instead. If you have questions, ask your instructors.

Finally, commit your setup steps and push to a new repo. Share that new repo with your project partner(s). Be sure to add them as a collaborator.

# 2. General Requirements

### Required Endpoints

You will need to expose the data through a multitude of API endpoints. All of your endpoints should follow these technical expectations:

* All endpoints should be fully tested for happy path AND sad path. **The Postman tests are not a substitute for writing your own tests.**
* All endpoints that return data will expect to return JSON data only
* All endpoints should be exposed under an `api` and version (`v0`) namespace (e.g. `/api/v0/markets`)
* API will be compliant to the [JSON API spec](https://jsonapi.org/) and match our requirements below precisely
  <!-- * if your tests pass but the Postman test does not, you have done something wrong. -->
* Controller actions should be limited to only the standard Rails actions and follow good RESTful convention.
* Endpoints such as `GET /api/v1/markets/search?parameters` will NOT follow RESTful convention, and that's okay. Consider creating an action that *appears* restful.
* In total, you will create **11 endpoints** (9 ReSTful, 2 non-ReSTful)

  #### ReSTful Endpoints:

    - **Market Endpoints**
      * get all markets
      * get one market
      * get all vendors for a market
    - **Vendor Endpoints**
      * get one vendor
      * create a vendor
      * update a vendor
      * delete a vendor
    - **MarketVendor Endpoints**
      * create a market_vendor
      * delete a market_vendor

  #### Non-ReSTful Endpoints:

    - **AR Endpoint**
      * get all markets within a city or state that's name or description match a string fragment

    - **Consume API Endpoint**
      * get cash dispensers (ATMs) close to a market location

### Error Responses

If the user causes an error for which you are sending a 400-series error code, the JSON body of the response should be an error object that contains a detailed description of the error. 

For example, 
```json
  {
      "errors": [
          {
              "detail": "Couldn't find Market with 'id'=123123123123"
          }
      ]
  }
```

You can customize the value of the `detail` element. But, you must always have a top level `errors` key that points to a collection.

        ]
    }
      ```
    </details>
</details>

<details><summary><h3>5. Create a Vendor</h3></summary>

#### Details
1. This endpoint should follow the pattern of `POST /api/v0/vendors`, and should pass ALL attributes required to create a vendor (`name`, `description`, `contact_name`, `contact_phone`, and `credit_accepted`) as JSON in the body of the request. (In postman, navigate to `Body` tab, select `raw` and change the format to `JSON` instead of `Text`)
2. This endpoint should create a new vendor resource.
3. A successful response will return a response with a `201` status code, and return the newly created vendor resource. 
4. If any number of attributes are left out in the body of the request, a status code of `400`, as well as a descriptive error message should be sent back in the response.
5. Validating the presence of a boolean value can be tricky since `false` is evaluated as `nil`. Validating the presence of a field that could be false will generate some a validation error when we don't mean it to. We'd suggest creating your own [custom validation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#custom-methods) for validating the presence of a boolean field.

    </details>
</details>

<details><summary><h3>6. Update a Vendor</h3></summary>

#### Details
1. This endpoint should follow the pattern of `PATCH /api/v0/vendors/:id`, and can pass any number and combination of attribtues to be updated (`name`, `description`, `contact_name`, `contact_phone`, and `credit_accepted`) as JSON in the body of the request. (In postman, navigate to `Body` tab, select `raw` and change the format to `JSON` instead of `Text`)
2. This endpoint should update an existing vendor with any parameters sent in via the body.
3. If someone were to try to update a vendor resource to have a `nil` or empty attribute, a proper 400-level status code as well as a descriptive error message should be sent back in the response.
4. A successful response will return the newly updated vendor resource. 

    <details><summary><h5>Example #1 üòÅ</h5></summary>

<details><summary><h3>7. Delete a Vendor</h3></summary>

#### Details
1. This endpoint should follow the pattern of `DELETE /api/v0/vendors/:id`
2. When a valid id is passed in, that vendor will be destroyed, as well as any associations that vendor had. A status code of `204` should be sent back, without any content in the body. 
3. If an invalid id is passed in, a 404 status code as well as a descriptive message should be sent back with the response.

<details><summary><h3>8. Create a MarketVendor</h3></summary>

#### Details
1. This endpoint should follow the pattern of `POST /api/v0/market_vendors`, and it should create a new association between a market and a vendor (so then, the vendor has a new market that they sell at).
2. When valid ids for vendor and market are passed in, a MarketVendor will be created, and a response will be sent back with a `201` status, detailing that a Vendor was added to a Market. 
3. After implementing the happy path for this endpoint, run it, and check that when you call `GET /api/v0/markets/:id/vendors` for the market to which you just added a vendor, that you see the newly associated vendor listed.
4. If an invalid vendor id or and invalid market id is passed in, a `404` status code as well as a descriptive message should be sent back with the response.
4. If a vendor id and/or a market id are not passed in, a `400` status code as well as a descriptive message should be sent back with the response.
5. If there already exists a MarketVendor with that `market_id` and that `vendor_id`, a response with a `422` status code and a message informing the client that that association already exists, should be sent back. Looking at [custom validation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#custom-methods) might help to implement a validation for uniqueness of the attributes for this resource.

<details><summary><h3>9. Delete a MarketVendor</h3></summary>

#### Details
1. This endpoint should follow the pattern of `DELETE /api/v0/market_vendors`, and it should destroy an existing association between a market and a vendor (so that a vendor no longer is listed at a certain market).
2. The `market_id` and the `vendor_id` should be passed in via the body. 
2. When a MarketVendor resource can be found with the passed in `vendor_id` and `market_id`, that resource should be destroyed, and a response will be sent back with a `204` status, with nothing returned in the body of the request.  
3. After implementing the happy path for this endpoint, run it, and check that when you call `GET /api/v0/markets/:id/vendors` for the market in which you just deleted an association to a vendor, that you don't see the recently removed vendor listed. 
4. If a MarketVendor resource can NOT be found with the passed in `vendor_id` and `market_id`, a 404 status code as well as a descriptive message should be sent back with the response.

<details><summary><h3>10. Search Markets by state, city, and/or name</h3></summary>

#### Details: 
1. The endpoint should be in the pattern of `GET /api/v0/markets/search`, and can accept `city`, `state`, and `name` parameters.
2. The following combination of parameters can be sent in at any time: 
  * `state`
  * `state`, `city`
  * `state`, `city`, `name`
  * `state`, `name`
  * `name`
3. The following combination of parameters can NOT be sent in at any time: 
  * `city`
  * `city`, `name`
4. If an invalid set of parameters are sent in, a proper error message should be sent back, along with a `422` status code. 
5. In the event that valid parameters are sent in, and only one market is returned from the search, the `data` top level key should still point to an array holding that one market resource data. 
6. Similar to above, in the event that valid parameters are sent in, and NO markets are returned, the `data` top level key should point to an empty array. And a status code of `200` should still be returned

<details><summary><h3>11. Get Cash Dispensers Near a Market</h3></summary>

#### Details: 
1. The endpoint should be in the pattern of `GET /api/v0/markets/:id/nearest_atms`
2. You will need to utilize the [TomTom API](https://developer.tomtom.com/) for this. Specifically, the category search endpoint. Find a category that would work for ATM's, and use the API to find ATM's near the location of the Farmer's Market. 
3. The atms that are returned should be in the order of closest to furthest away.
4. If an invalid market id is passed in, a 404 status as well as a descriptive error message should be sent back in the response.
5. The `data` top level key should always point to an array even if one or zero atms were located near the market location.
