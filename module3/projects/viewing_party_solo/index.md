# Viewing Party API

## Project Description

For this project, you will be finishing an API that provides endpoints to explore movies and create a Viewing Party Event that invites users and keeps track of a host. Your job is to connect with an [external API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and collect relevant information, set up the database to allow the creation of viewing parties, and handle some basic authorization.

Since this project has already been started by another developer, this is considered a *brownfield* project - this will likely echo your experience on-the-job: picking up where another developer left off (e.g. a “legacy” project), and thereby inheriting some of their code’s quirks and foibles. It is not your job to fix those issues, rather focus on what this project’s deliverables are instead of fixing old stuff.


## Learning Goals

* Consume an API that requires authentication
* Build some CRUD functionality for a many-to-many relationship
* Utilize at least one mocking tool for testing API consumption
* Implement authorization for endpoints
* Explore and build off existing code in a legacy codebase
* Organize and refactore new code to be more maintainable
