length: 1 week
tags: API consumption, solo project

## Project Description

For this project, you will be finishing an application that allows users to explore movies and create a Viewing Party Event that invites users and keeps track of a host. Mainly, your job is to connect with an external API and collect relevant information on each movie, its cast, and other information, to display it on each Viewing Party page. 

Since this project has already been started by another developer, this is considered a *brownfield* project - this will likely echo your experience on-the-job: picking up where another developer left off (e.g. a "legacy" project), and thereby inheriting some of their code's quirks and foibles. It is not your job to fix those issues, rather focus on what **this** project's deliverables are instead of fixing old stuff. 

## Learning Goals

### Explicit
Below are technical goals that you should be applying in this project.<br>
The priority of these goals are demonstrated using a star grading system.<br>
By the end of this project: <br>
  Student should have a functional understanding of the concept ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ <br>
  Student should have a familiar understanding, but may still have questions ⭐ ⭐ <br>
  Student should know of the concept, but need further resources to implement ⭐

* Consume JSON APIs that require authentication ⭐ ⭐ ⭐
* Test consumption of APIs (facades, services, poros) ⭐ ⭐ ⭐
* Organize and refactor new code to be more maintainable ⭐ ⭐  

_Note: See [Learning Goals](../../misc/learning_goals) to see at what level these skills need to be by week 6 of this inning._

### Implicit
Below are skills that are more general/necessary on the job that are practiced by completing the goals above.

* Reading Documentation
* Implementing concepts that are not explicitly taught
* Practice individual research (articles, videos, mentors)
* Prioritizing goals/user stories
* Time management

## Project Requirements

Project requirements can be found [here](./requirements).

## Evaluation

Instead of a typical evaluation session with an instructor, you will be grouped together with 2-3 other students and will display your application & walk through your solution one by one. Your cohort-mates as well as your instructor will provide feedback and ask questions about your code during this [evaluation/feedback session](./evaluation).

Your project will be evaluated based on [this rubric](./rubric).
