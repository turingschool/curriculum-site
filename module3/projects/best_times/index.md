## Project Description

You are a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to search NYT Best Sellers. This app will allow users to see NYT Best Sellers, see other books by those best-selling authors, and allow registered users to keep track of favorite books.

Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture. The front-end will communicate with your back-end through an API. Your job is to expose that API that satisfies the front-end team's requirements.

## Learning Goals

* Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
* Expose an API that requires an authentication token
* Expose an API for CRUD functionality
* Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
* Test both API consumption and exposure, making use of at least one mocking tool (VCR, Webmock, etc). 

## Requirements

The project must expose all of the endpoints [listed here](./requirements)

## Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on [this rubric](./rubric)
