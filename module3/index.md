## Overview

In Module 3, students will further explore the fundamentals of Rails and begin exploring React as a framework for front end JavaScript applications. Towards the end of the module, students will participate in the Consultancy Group Project, which will allow them to pitch their own project ideas and own the entire software development lifecycle. By the end of the module, students will be able to build service-oriented full-stack applications with both Ruby on Rails and ReactJS.
