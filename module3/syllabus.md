## Projects

Projects require students to apply new concepts from class and build on existing knowledge from prior coursework. All graded projects will be assesed on a scale of Well Below Expectations, Below Expectations, Meets Expectations, and Exceeds Expectations. Meets Expectations is considered a passing score. Students will have a total of 4 projects in Module 1:

* **Paired Project** - Begin Monday week 1, due Friday week 1.
  * Students must pass either the **Paired Project** or **Group Project** to be promoted.
  * The goal of this project is for students to practice all of the key concepts of module 1 covered in the prework and week 1.
* **Solo Project #1** - Begin Monday week 2, due Friday week 2.
  * This project is "safe to fail", meaning it will not count towards the final promotion decision at the end of the module, but students must attempt the project.
  * Students will be given feedback on their project, but scores will not count towards promotion.
* **Group Project (Consultancy)** - Begin Monday week 4, due end of week 5.
  * Students must pass either the **Paired Project** or **Group Project** to be promoted.
* **Final Solo Project** - Begin end of week 5, due Wednesday week 6.
  * Meets Expectations is considered a passing score and this project cannot score "Well Below Expectations" in any category.
  * Students must pass the **Final Solo Project** to be promoted.

In summary, students must submit each completed project to be eligible for promotion, and must pass _either_ the Paired or Group projects, in addition to successfully completing the Final Solo project. 

## Challenges

In week 3, students will participate in 3 **Independent Challenges** that will build on previous projects. The challenges given will correspond directly with classes on topics explored in the morning, with sufficient work time given that day to complete the challenge. It is for this reason that students are recommended to complete their paired and solo projets _in their entirety_ to be successful during the week 3 challenges. Students can ask for specific instructor feedback on completed challenges if they wish. 

## Independent Practice

Students can independently practice any and all topics explored in classes or through projects in their own free work time during the week's scheduled work time, or over a given weekend. They can use [this resource](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/M3_weekend_practice) as a starting point, or reach out to an instructor to get more targeted suggestions. 

## MidMod Assessment

In week 3, students will participate in the **MidMod Assessment**. The MidMod is not counted towards promotion and is meant to mimic the same format and similar difficulty to the final assessment in week 6. 
Students can work on a practice assessment at [this link](./practice_assessments/practice_assessment).

## Scores

Projects, Assessments, and Independent Assessments will be assessed on the following scale:

* Below Expectations
* Approaching Expectations
* Meets Expectations (Passing)
* Exceeds Expectations (Exceptional)

Projects, Independent Challenges, and Assessments will be broken into 3-4 sections. Direction will be given for each project or assessment as to what is considered "meeting expectations", and beyond which point would be considered "exceptional". 

## Support

**Mentors / Rocks**: Students can reach out to their colleagues in mod 4 or alumni mentors to be paired with for a specific amount of time/project or an entire inning, depending on availability. 

**One-on-Ones**: Students can request to meet with an instructor to talk about non-technical topics at any time. This can include a studentâ€™s progress, stress management, suggestions for improvement, etc. This conversation should not involve coding, whiteboarding, etc. These will be guaranteed if requested, and will often appear on the calendar along with a provided sign-up sheet.

**Instructor Pairing**: Students can request paired work time with an instructor.

**Feedback from Instructors**: Students will receive feedback and/or scores from instructors for each project, challenge and assessment.  In addition, students can request additional feedback on a project or independent practice at any point in the inning. 

## Portfolios

Students must complete a Portfolio, and participate in a Portfolio Review. Instructions for the Portfolio can be found [here](./misc/final_project_and_portfolio_guide).

## Slack

Instructors will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students.

When sending a direct message (DM), students should DM ALL instructors. Exceptions are when a DM only applies to one instructor, for instance scheduling a one-on-one.

## Attendance

Attendance is required at **80% or above** to pass Module 3. Attendance will be counted at all scheduled activities from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm, and specific methods for counting attend. Per the Student Course Catalog, tardiness will be counted as absence.
