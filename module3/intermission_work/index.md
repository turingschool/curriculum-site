# Module 3 Intermission Work

## Required Deliverables

### You must submit all of these assignments. *They are due the Saturday before the start of the inning by 5pm*

Submit your work here: [Survey Link](https://forms.gle/p2VnbLdA3QTVVC8N9)

Versions:
 - Ruby 3.2.2 (run `ruby  -v`)
 - Rails 7.1.x (run `rails -v`)
 - Node > v16 (run `node -v`, you are likely on the latest Node version by using `nvm`)

If you need help updating Ruby or Rails versions, check out [this page](https://backend.turing.edu/module3/misc/ruby_and_rails_versions). If you need to revisit Node installation, check out [this page](https://mod0.turing.edu/computer-setup#install-node). 

### 1. Technical Resume

To start your Professional Development work in mod 3, plan to spend 60-90 minutes completing [this async lesson on crafting your Resume](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDtaMhRxM226YZWQqe93ILUpBIzDLzXFMEKOmjT1yUc/edit#slide=id.p1). 

### 2. Intro to React

Complete this [IdeaBox tutorial](../lessons/react_ideabox). This tutorial will take you about 4 hours to complete.

### 3. Consuming APIs with Ruby

Complete [this exercise](../lessons/consuming_an_api_ruby) to gain familiarity with consuming an external API within your Set List application! 

### 4. Dev Best Practices

Read [Sandi Metz's _Rules for Developers_](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers) and take some notes on what you learn!

### 5. Practice with Deeply Nested Collections

As we know, when consuming APIs, the data is often returned in deeply nested collections, so when using Ruby, we will need to tap into our Mod 1 skills to practice digging through them to retrieve the data you need.

Fork and clone [Here Be Dragons](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/here-be-dragons). Get the tests to pass. This is something you'll turn in with your submission, so make sure you make a forked copy of it. 

### 6. Service-Oriented Architecture

Review this lesson on Service-Oriented Architecture [here](../lessons/intro_to_soa).

### Optional Exercises and Exploration

#### 1. Additional SQL Practice
* There are some great exercises for practicing SQL commands here: [https://pgexercises.com/](https://pgexercises.com/)

#### 2. HTTP Request/Response Cycle Review
* On one piece of paper, write out all of the parts of an example `HTTP GET` request (Diagram the DNS look-up as well as how a Rails Application would handle the request via MVC)
  * **Even better:** write your explanation as a metaphor
* On a separate piece of paper, write out an example 200 response to that request with all of the parts

#### 3. Data Structures and Algorithms

Read: [An Overview of Data Structures for Ruby Developers](https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/04/ruby-data-structures/)

We are going to be covering various data structures to prepare you for the job hunt and technical interviews. Complete this former M1 project, [Beat Box](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/beat_box).

If you've done Beat Box, let's get serious and have a [Date Night](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/date_night)!

#### 4. Security

* Check out [Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/lessons) and go through these lessons, or whatever seems interesting to you!
  * SQL Injection
  * Cross-Site Request Forgery
  * Crros-Site Scripting
  * Password Mismanagement

* Read the docs on [Rails Security](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html). We recommend focusing in particular on the sections regarding:
