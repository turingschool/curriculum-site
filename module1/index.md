## Overview  

In Module 1, students will learn programming fundamentals by building software in teams with Ruby and followwing object-oriented programming. They will develop skills to write automated tests, pseudocode, write implementation code, and refactor code to meet Ruby conventions. Through group projects and regular pairing exercises, students will learn skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers. Along the way students will see glimpses of JavaScript and how the fundamentals they are learning in Ruby translate to many programming languages.
