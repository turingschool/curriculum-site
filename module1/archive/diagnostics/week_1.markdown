# Week 1 Diagnostic

Create a gist and answer the following questions.

## Floats and Integers

*   What's the difference between a float and integer?
*   What's are the similarities and differences between BigNum and FixNum?
*   What will `4.0 / 2` return?
*   What will `1.5.to_i.to_f` return?
*   What part of this expression (`"hi" *  5`?) is "syntactic sugar"? What does that mean?
*   What will `10 % 3` return?
*   What will `5 == 10/2` return?
*   How can you write 5 to the 2nd power?


## Strings

*   How can you grab the substring “ell” from “hello”?
*   Give an example of string concatenation and string interpolation.
*   Give examples of three variable names: a "valid name" (it will work) that goes against Ruby style, an "invalid" name (it will trigger an error), and a valid and stylistically conventional name.


## Arrays

*   How do you add to an array?
*   What will `[1,2,3].shuffle` do?
*   What do `shift` and `unshift` do?
*   Name 3 ways to retrieve `4` from this array: `[4,3,5]`
*   How would you print each word from this list (`["hello", "goodbye", "cactus"]`) to terminal within this output:

```
The word is "hello".
The word is "goodbye".
The word is "cactus".
```

## Flow control

*   What's the difference between a `while` and `until` loop?
*   How do you escape a pry in the middle of a loop?


## Enumerables (`.each`)

*   What is the purpose of an enumerable?
*   What are the two different ways that you can represent a block?
*   Given this array `["Beth", "Lauren", "Ilana"]`. How would you create a new array of just the first initials of each name?


## Classes and instance methods
*   When you're defining a class, how do you store _attributes_?
*   What is the difference between attr_readers, attr_writers, and attr_accessors? What do each do?
*   What method corresponds with `.new` when you create a new instance of a class?


## Methods, arguments and scopes

*   Describe the scope that methods create. Are variables created in that scope accessible elsewhere?
*   What does the method scope have access to?
