```ruby
night_shifts = ["josh", "andrew", "sal", "casey", "beth", "ilana", "lauren", "sal", "casey", "casey", "nate", "beth", "nate", "nate", "casey", "casey", "casey", "andrew"]
```

*Baseline:* Given an array, create a hash in which the key is an element in the array and the value is the number of occurrences of that element.

*Extension:* Given the hash from the baseline challenge, print each key-value pair, in descending order by occurrence number, with the phrase “Casey worked 6 night shifts.” If a person only worked one night shift, the phrase should be “Josh worked 1 night shift.”
