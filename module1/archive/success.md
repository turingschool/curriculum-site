## Module 1 Learning Goals

Academic success in BEM1 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

A student who graduates from this module will be able to do the following.



### Ruby Syntax & Style

#### Mastery

* Identify and apply best choice methods for strings, integers, collections
* Consistently identify best-choice enumerables for interacting with collections
* Use if/else statements, loops, conditional statements, and boolean operators to manage control flow

#### Functional

* Import and export data to .csv and .txt files
* Speak clearly and accurately about language mechanics and correctly name the elements of Ruby syntax
* Explain the difference between class and instance methods


### Breaking Logic Into Components

#### Mastery

* Translate abstract requirements into programmable concepts using whiteboarding and pseudocode
* Decompose complex technical challenges into a series of smaller challenges
* Develop complex algorithms and implement them in Ruby

#### Functional

* Translate specification requirements to tests that will drive design
* Identify use cases for Modules and Super Classes



### Debugging

* Use debugging tools (e.g. `pry`) to help investigate assumptions and verify code behavior
* Print to console to verify code behavior
* Use pry or irb console sessions to test code tactics and address bugs
* Demonstrate ability to choose appropriate debugging tactic to solve problems



### Test Driven Development

#### Mastery

* Understand and describe why we test software
* Understand and describe tests they did not write

* Understand and explain how CLI, text editor and browser interact

#### Functional

* Move between programs without relying on mouse
* Make use of keyboard shortcuts to minimize distractions



### Collaboration

#### Mastery

#### Functional

* Articulate personal and learning needs in a constructive, clear manner
* Advocate for and co-create team dynamics that balance the learning goals of all team members



### Career Development (Additional Details

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
