## Learning Goals

Promoted students will demonstrate proficiency in the material outlined in the [Module 1 Learning Goals](./learning_goals).

## Projects

You will complete four projects throughout Module 1, each of which will be assessed according to a rubric. A passing project will "Meet Expectations" (per the rubric) for most categories. You must submit every project to be eligible for promotion.

* Week 1-2: [Solo Project #1](./projects)
  * The Solo Project is evaluated, but does not count toward promotion
* Week 2-3: [Solo Project #2](./projects)
* Week 3-4: [Paired Project](./projects)
  * You must pass EITHER the Paired Project OR Solo Project #2
* Week 5-6: [Group Project](./projects)
  * You must pass the Final Project
  * No rubric category can score Below Expectations

## Assessments and Independent Challenges

You will complete two assessments and three weekly Independent Challenges in Module 1, each of which will be assesed on a scale of Below Expectations, Approaching Expectations, Meets Expectations, and Exceeds Expectations. Meets Expectations is considered a passing score.

### Assessments
1. Mid Module Assessment (aka "Mid Mod")
  * The Mid Mod is evaluated, but does not count toward promotion

1. Final Independent Challenge (aka "Final IC", Week 6)
  In order to be promoted to Module 2:
  * You must earn a _Meets Expectations_ on the Week 6 Final IC to be promoted to Module 2. Students who do not will be offered a re-take.

### Independent Challenges
1. Weekly Independent Challenges (ICs)
  * Weeks 2, 4, 5 (aka "Week 2 IC", "Week 4 IC", etc.)
  * The weekly IC's are evaluated, but do not count toward promotion. They are practice for the final Week 6 IC.


Students can reference the [Module 1 Syllabus](./syllabus) and [Module 1 Schedule](./schedule) for more details on these assessments. Students can reference the [Practice Assessments](./practice_assessments) page for example assessments.

## Professional Development

Promoted students will have attended and actively engaged in all PD sessions. They will present a polished and well thought-out answer to "Tell me about yourself", something that instruction and feedback will be given on during the live sessions.

## Portfolio

Students will complete a Portfolio, and participate in a Portfolio Review. Instructions for the Portfolio can be found [here](./portfolios).
