title: SE Portfolio Requirements
---

## Purpose

We believe that portfolio sessions are important opportunities for three areas of growth:

1. **Confronting Progress:** Portfolios give students the opportunity to understand their own progress in pursuit of their career as a software developer.
2. **Practicing Narrative:** Portfolio presentations push students to articulate their narrative of their technical and professional journey.
3. **Direct Feedback:** Portfolio feedback allows students to receive a summative perspective of their performance, including threads of successes and areas of growth.

**Portfolio presentations are a requirement for all students, regardless of whether they are repeating a module or not.**

## Plan

Students will give a 5 minute presentation to an instructor on a 1:1 Zoom call. Your cohort calendars should contain a sign up sheet for grabbing a time slot. Most students choose to create a visual presentation with Google Slides, PowerPoint, Prezi, etc. Your presentation should be focused on answering the questions from the appropriate dropdown below. After the student presentation, instructors will provide brief feedback to the student about their performance that inning.

### M1 > M2

**Focus: Your Background and Vision**
- How does your past experience link to your work at Turing and in the eventual career?
- What strengths are you bringing with you to this new industry?
- Why are you motivated to become a software developer?

### M2 > M3

**Focus: Collaborative Learning & Building**
- What particular skills, talent, or perspectives do you bring to a team?
- What makes for a successful team? What derails a well-intentioned team?
- What are some tools and systems that you've used this inning to help with collaborative technical work? (i.e. project boards, code reviews, etc)
- How will your experience in team projects influence your professional work in the industry?
</section>

<section class="dropdown">
### M3 > M4

**Focus: Growth Trajectory**
- Why have you been successful up to this point at Turing?
- How are you able to learn new technologies and grow new skills on your own?
- What do you do when you get stuck on a technical problem? (Be specific about the steps you take to get unstuck!)
- How does your technical work here link to the ways you want to learn and grow in your job/career?

### Repeating Students (any module)
Spend this time reflecting on the wins and challenges from this inning and looking ahead at the next 7 weeks. Instead of making a slide deck presentation, you will make a copy of [this Repeating Student Portfolio Reflections document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaFP3loZeNSOv5oG5xkYPpkCzx_UOwcIXxH9JHAliVs/edit) and add your answers to the questions. On your 1:1 Zoom call, you and your instructor will talk through your reflections on this inning and your plans for next inning.
