---

## Learning Goals

Promoted students will demonstrate proficiency in the material covered in Module 1.

## Projects

You will complete four [projects](../projects/) throughout Module 1, each of which will be assessed according to a rubric. A passing project will "Meet Expectations" (per the rubric) for most categories. You must submit every project to be eligible for promotion.

* Week 1-2: Solo Project #1
  * The Solo Project is evaluated, but does not count toward promotion
* Week 2-3: Solo Project #2
* Week 3-4: Paired Project
  * You must pass EITHER the Paired Project OR Solo Project #2
* Week 5-6: Group Project
  * You must pass the Final Project
  * No rubric category can score Below Expectations

## Assessments and Independent Challenges

You will complete two assessments and three weekly Independent Challenges in Module 1, each of which will be assesed on a scale of Below Expectations, Approaching Expectations, Meets Expectations, and Exceeds Expectations. Meets Expectations is considered a passing score.

### Assessments
1. Mid Module Assessment (aka "Mid Mod")
  * The Mid Mod is evaluated, but does not count toward promotion

1. Final Independent Challenge (aka "Final IC", Week 6)
  In order to be promoted to Module 2:
  * You must earn a _Meets Expectations_ on the Week 6 Final IC to be promoted to Module 2. Students who do not will be offered a re-take.

### Independent Challenges
* Independent Challenges (ICs)
  * Week 3, Week 4 (optional), and Week 5 
  * The weekly IC's are evaluated, but do not count toward promotion. They are practice for the final Week 6 IC.

Student can find independent challenges to practice [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/se-mod1-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/README.md). 

## Professional Development

Promoted students will have attended and actively engaged in all PD sessions. They will present a polished and well thought-out answer to "Tell me about yourself", something that instruction and feedback will be given on during the live sessions.

## Portfolio

Students will complete a Portfolio, and participate in a Portfolio Review. Instructions for the Portfolio can be found [here](./portfolio_guidelines).
