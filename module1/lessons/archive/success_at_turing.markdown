## Mindsets

### Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset

* Carol Dweck: [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322?ie=UTF8&redirect=true&tag=braipick-20)
* **Fixed Mindset**: Intelligence is innate (static)
* **Growth Mindset**: Intelligence is developed
* "Passion for learning rather than hunger for approval"

Mindsets control how we approach challenging experiences, especially:

* Challenges
* Obstacles
* Effort
* Criticism
* Success (or struggles) of Others (Empathy)

**Turing's pedagogy and curriculum is heavily driven by this philosophy**

## Action Plan -- What do I do?

1. Write everything on paper -- Numerous [studies](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/) show greater retention when writing by hand. We can learn a lot about computers without actually using computers. (Hands-on activities, arts and crafts, separating between **Conceptual** Learning Time and **Application** Learning Time)
2. Write shitloads of code -- **ABC** -- "Always Be Coding" -- Analogies to Writing or Painting -- Do you expect to create a masterpiece on the first try? Many people's misunderstanding: **Code is the tool, not the End Goal**
3. Bias toward action -- In your situation, time spent designing (or fretting) is almost never more valuable than time spent writing code (see point 2).
4. In programming there's truth and there's opinion. Mostly opinion. -- Be prepared for multiple approaches. Work with mentors. Keep an open mind (growth mindset). Try to understand not just **what someone is doing** but the thought process or analysis behind it. **Everything in software is tradeoffs**.
5. Get over yourself -- See: **Growth Mindset**. You will struggle. The program is designed with this in mind. Grade-anti-inflation. Not looking for the "passive" / "warm bath" experience of moderate success.
6. Handle your shit - Inside Turing and oustide Turing. Constant theme of students who struggle: Overcome by distractions outside of school. Turing is very time consuming (obvious) but also extremely **Focus-Consuming** (less obvious). Do whatever you need to do to clear the slate.
7. People like you are successful at this -- 15 Turing Cohorts + 2x Gschool + 1x Hungry Academy -- ~ 250 Alumni, ~350 current students + alumni. Someone fitting your profile of self-identification (whatever that may be) has gone through the program and been successful.
8. We need you all in -- Contrary to common belief, can't **MAKE** anyone do anything. Students: "Why do I have to do...(XYZ)" -- Well, you don't have to -- you can always leave. You have to decide to do this.

## Structural Components

### Educational Approach

* You learn by doing -- Can't learn programming via osmosis. Very applicative skill -- Our primary objective is to get you coding **as much and as soon as possible**
* Gradual release of responsibility - **GRR** (this is the sound you will make when the responsibility is released) -- See Also: ARR (abrupt release of responsibility)
* Spiraling of expertise
* Community-driven education - Biggest strength of Turing -- You will interact with ~150 other students during your time. Learning is exponential when passed around in this way.

### Modules

* 6 weeks
* Each is pass/fail
* Built up a portfolio
* Present that portfolio to argue for promotion
* M1 and M2 highly structured, M3 more independence, M4 very independent

### Weeks

* Monday & Tuesday are more instructional
* Wednesday & Thursday have more work and evaluation/feedback time
* Friday is community day

### Classes

* Typical class is 90-minutes with one instructor focused on one topic
* Classes are supposed to be "just in time" to apply the skill to your project
* Classes may be lecture, code-along, tutorial, small group work, etc

### Projects

* Projects are where you cement your learning
* Typically 1-2 weeks long
* Evaluated by an instructor
* Building blocks of your portfolio

### Echo/Foxtrot

* Why? Harvey Mudd & graduation rates
* Come in off the diving board or the zero-entry
* Everyone ends up in the same pool
* Some classes together, so separate
* Starting Week 4 the boundary starts getting erased
* Week 5/6 there is no Echo/Foxtrot
