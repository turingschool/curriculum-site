Remote Pairing
=============

Pairing is fairly straightforward when you're side-by-side with
your pair. But sometimes you'll want to collaborate remotely --
perhaps with an out-of-town mentor or at night while you and a teammate
are at home.

Fortunately there's been a lot of progress over the last several
years on tooling to support this kind of workflow. Some of the tools
have gotten so good that you may even find you *prefer* a "remote"
workflow over a standard side-by-side one.

In this session, we're going to practice pairing "remotely" while
both you and your pair are in the building

Exercises
-----------

For this session we'll use [these exercises](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/fundamental_logic_gates.markdown)
on fundamental logic gates. You and your pair will be working together
to implement Ruby simulations of some fundamental computer hardware
concepts.

Setup
--------

If you have not already, install [Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/).
Screenhero is a remote screen-sharing application that let's you and a
partner share control of the same desktop. Additionally, the app includes
audio chat so you can communicate while you work.
It has a small learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, the interface
is quite nice. (**Note:** you may have to sign in with your slack account
to download the app.)

**Sharing Your Screen**

Once the app is downloaded, you should get a Screenhero menu bar icon
where you can add friends and initiate a screen sharing session. Add
your pair and select one person to initiate the session.

**Slack Integration**

Additionally, Screenhero includes a slack integration that makes it
easy to initiate a session. From the slack app, type `/hero @username`
to initiate a screenhero session with another user.

Sessions
----------

Spend the next ~90 minutes working through the challenges outlined
in the [exercise](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/fundamental_logic_gates.markdown).

Don't forget to take pomodoros!

For each 25 minute session, try one of the following techniques:

### Side-By-Side

Use your traditional pairing setup (sitting next to your partner),
but this time use screenhero. You'll find that you both see and control
the same screen, which is nice.

### Face-to-Face

Use Screenhero, but sit in such a way that you and your partner are
facing, and slightly to one side of each other. This usually works best
if you sit on opposite sides of a desk and put your laptops next to
one another but facing opposite directions.

The nice thing about this approach is you both still see and control
the same screen, but you get a much better view of your partner's
face, which makes communication easier.

### Screenhero from another room

Finally try simulating a true remote pairing setup by using Screenhero
to pair from different rooms (or different sides of a room) within
Turing. This time you'll need to use headphones and (ideally) a microphone
to get audio communication with your partner.
