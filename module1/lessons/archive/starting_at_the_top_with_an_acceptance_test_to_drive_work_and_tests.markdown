There is no truth, the truth you make up will manifest for you when you go to use it,
you need to make a [leap of faith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFntFdEGgws)!

[Here are my notes](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/37e4cf3bea6541023bab) on starting projects.

Lets practice all together on [Chisel](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/chisel.html),
loosely following [this](https://vimeo.com/131588133) video.

## Structure

1. A few minutes talking about how you can build on top of nothing and it will be there when you go to use it.
1. Watch me do it for 30ish minutes, on Chisel explaining what I'm doing.
   No computers, you don't copy my code, notice my thought pattern.
1. Break
1. I do it, you watch, then you do it. Rinse. Wash. Repeat.
1. Break
1. Choose between going further with it, if it seems like there is more value to that,
   or starting it over again for the value of repetition.
