## Portfolio Workshop and Peer Evaluations


This morning we're going to spend some time getting our portfolios ready for
next week. Spend the next 90 minutes working on your portfolio. Divide your
time as follows:

### 60 minutes -- Open Portfolio Workshop

Spend this time gathering your materials and preparing your portfolio
according to the instructions [here](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios).

This is a great time to get help from your classmates in sorting out any git
or formatting issues you have. Don't forget to use Atom's built-in markdown previewer to check the formatting on
your document!

Aim to have the following at the end of the hour:

1. A completed first draft of your portfolio document (minus any remaining pieces from the last week)
2. Your portfolio committed to git and pushed to **your fork** of the turingschool/portfolios repo
3. An **open pull request** from your fork back to the turingschool/portfolios repo. In the subject
of this PR add **WIP** so that we know it isn't final -- next week when you push your final edits
you can remove the **WIP** note to indicate you are finished.

### 30 minutes -- Peer Portfolio Critique

For the remaining 30 minutes, pair up with a student in your cohort and spend **15 minutes apiece**
reviewing one another's portfolios. Use the [Rubric](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/rubric.markdown)
as a guide when evaluating each category. Use the notes that you receive from this portfolio
critique to improve and polish your final portfolio for next week!
