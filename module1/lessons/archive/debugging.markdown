## Standards

## Structure

* 30 minutes -- Discuss the 4 techniques listed below
* 30 minutes -- Students independently work on Erroneous Creatures exercise

## Tools

* [pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) - `gem install pry`
* [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - `brew install ag`

## Lesson

### 1. Get Feedback

* TDD
* Pry
* Pace your progress with your __feedback__
* It's easy to get in the mindset of "let me just try this 1 more thing" -- don't make blind
stabs in the dark.
* Use your tools to get meaningful feedback to guide each change.

### 2. Verify Assumptions

The most common errors students run into result not from doing something bad,
but from doing a _right_ thing to the wrong type of object.

This is usually a case of invalid assumptions. I thought I had a string but I
actually have an integer. I thought I had an Array of Hashes but I actually have
an Array of Arrays. I thought I had a Pizza but I actually had a ball of Pizza Dough.

To avoid this we need to be extremely disciplined about verifying all of the implicit
assumptions throughout our code.

__How do we verify assumptions?__

* __Tests__ - Diligent tests that cover the input and output for every method
will go a long way to avoid this type of problem.
* __Pry__ - When you run into a seemingly mysterious error, one of your first
reactions should be to pry into the context of the error and check the class of
every object. You may find some surprises.

### 3. Read Stack Traces

Say it again:

__Read Stack Traces__

Once more, with feeling:

__Read Stack Traces__

* Stack Traces -- list all lines of code touched along the path to an exception
* Tell us what the error was and how we got there
* Gives us a file name and line of code to look in

#### How to use a Stack Trace

1. Look for the "top" or "end" of the trace -- generally the error will be one
of the last things that happened (since errors halt execution), so we want to
focus on the most recent lines of our trace, since this is usually where we'll find the problem
2. Look for lines referencing __our__ code. Your average stack trace usually includes
lots of lines that pass through code that isn't ours (ruby internals, gems we're using, etc).
Usually it's our code that is the problem, so try to zero in on those lines.
3. Read the error message 2 times before you go do anything
4. Focus on 2 things: What did we try to do? and To what did we try to do it?

For example:

```
NoMethodError: undefined method `+' for nil:NilClass
```

A diligent reading of this error message will tell me 2 things
off the bat:

1. we tried to add something to an object
2. that object was `nil`, which does not support adding to it

This information, in combination with the line number where the error
occurred, allows me to go directly to that place in the file
and start looking for anywhere I'm adding 2 things. Likely one
of them will turn out to be `nil`.

Using the stack trace effectively allows me to go directly
to the source of the problem, as opposed to reading random lines
of code hoping that the problem will jump out at me.

### 4. Tracing Values Through Code

This is often the next step after we've "diagnosed" one
of the problems above.

For example, I had an __assumption__ about one of my objects --
that it would be an Array of hashes each containing a key of `:name`.

Thanks to an error message and some pry-poking, I conclude that this
assumption is incorrect -- my object is actually an Array of strings,
and thus doesn't work correctly in the context I'm trying to use it.

My next step is to figure out __how__ did the object end up in
this state. This requires a bit of mental exercise to trace the
object through the path it followed before it reached the site of
the error.

I sometimes think of this as filling in a mental "checklist" --
start from the location of your error and work backwards through
each line that touched your object before it got there.

At each line, ask yourself: "What is the type of the object at this
point and what is its value?"

More often than not this process will lead you to a point where
the mistake is obvious -- "Oh darn I accidentally turned each hash
into a string at this line...", etc.

## Exercise - Erroneous Creatures

Let's get some practice using these techniques.
Clone this [Erroneous Creatures](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/erroneous_creatures)
repository.

It contains some implementations of the Mythical Creatures exercises
that are riddled with small bugs.

Use the debugging techniques discussed above to diagnose and fix the
bugs, and get your creatures back to passing.
