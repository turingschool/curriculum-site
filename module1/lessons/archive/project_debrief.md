## Project Debrief

We spend a lot of time thinking about Defining the Relationship before we dive into a project. But it's also valuable to spend some time after the project is done debriefing and reflecting on how it went. In fact the [Retrospective](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/april/key-elements-of-sprint-retrospective) is one of the key components of a good agile development process.

Now that you've completed a large project, spend 45 minutes to 1 hour debriefing with your partner. Try to be honest and focused in your discussion. Look for things that went well, things that didn't go well, and any overall trends or tendencies you noticed about your workflow or process.

(**Hint** -- Notes from this session would make a great addition to your portfolio...)

Use the following questions to guide your discussion:

### Project Retro Questions

1. Identify 3 things went well. Why do you think these were successful?
2. Identify 3 things that didn't go well. Why do you think these were unsuccessful?
3. Identify 2 things that was supposed to happen but didn't. What did happen instead? Why was there a difference between what you expected to happen and what did? (Our method was supposed to work but didn't is not a good answer. Look for things about your process or collaboration)
4. Identify 2 organizational constraints or we faced? How did we overcome them or did we?
5. What existing techniques or approaches from past projects enhanced or enabled our performance on this project?
6. Did the team meet sufficiently often and work productively together?
7. Could time pressures have been alleviated by organizing the work differently?
8. Could we have taken another approach to reach our goals more efficiently and effectively?
9. Was the goal always clear?
10. Were the instructions always clear?
11. How can we do better next time?
