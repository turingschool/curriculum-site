## Learning Goals

* Understand how object-oriented programming is similar to storytelling
* Be able to find the characters of a programming story
* Be able to create actions for those characters
* Understand the role of attributes in an instance
* Understand the difference between classes and instances
* Practice defining a class and creating instances of that class

## Structure

* 25 - Storytelling (small groups & all together)
* 25 - Programming Stories (all together)
* 25 - Building a Car

## Storytelling

### Warmup - 5 Minutes

Break into groups of three near your current seat. At least one person needs to tell a story.

Here are some prompt ideas:

* Think of the closest you've come or succeeded at getting arrested.
* Think of your longest day.
* Think of the furthest you've ever been from home.

### Full-Group Discussion: Human Stories & Interaction

The concrete facts of a plot don't make a story interesting:

* "Kids crash land on an island, argue, and some die as they recreate the problems of adult society."
* "Young woman and man meet on a ship. It sinks. He dies."
* "Hackers fuck up the perfect paradise that computers built for them for no real gain."

#### Energy of a Story

* What makes a story? Characters, Conflict, Change, Resolution, Hierarchy, Focus
* Experience story elements (Conflict, Change, Resolution) via characters
* Characters struggle and change through conflict (person v person, person v environment, person v themselves)
* The "state" of a character throughout the story -- how are they feeling,
where are they, etc
* Characters take action -- their choices and behaviors drive the story
* Characters __Interact__ -- Think about a play -- the entire story is
driven by dialogue (relevant [quote from Alan Kay](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKayOnMessaging))

#### Linking to Object-Oriented Programming

* Identify the "characters" -- what things are we interested in
* Give our characters the ability to develop over time -- what are their
attributes, their "state"
* Let our characters "act" -- give them behaviors and use those behaviors
to drive the change
* Let our characters "interact" -- develop systems gradually by defining the key
elements and connecting them over time

## Programming Stories

Let's talk about the big picture ideas of Object Oriented programming:

* **objects** and **conversations**
* **messages** and **responses**
* the **class** definition
* creating **instances** of a class
* writing our own **language**
* how to **write a method**
* how to **accept an argument** and **use it**
* the concept of a **call stack**
* the role of **attributes**
* creating **instance variables** to store **attribute values**
* combining it all together

### Concepts Exploration: Hamlet - 10 Minutes

Let's talk about Shakespeare's Hamlet. If you were going to implement Hamlet in code, you would have to have a Horacio class, and then you would have to instantiate it.

```ruby
class Horacio
end

h = Horacio.new
```

Whatever it means to be Horacio, you would define in the class, and then create an instance of the class. This is
the idea of Horacio-ness and you would create one Horacio from that mold.

Contrast that with something like a generic guard:

```ruby
class Guard
  attr_reader :name

  def initialize(name)
    @status = :guarding
    @name = name
  end

  def march
    @status = :marching
  end

  def halt
    @status = :guarding
  end

  def current_status
    @status
  end
end

g1 = Guard.new("A Guard Has No Name")
g2 = Guard.new("A Guard Also Has No Name")
g3 = Guard.new("A Guard Still Has No Name")

g1.name
g3.name
[g1, g2, g3].each{|g| g.march}
g2.current_status
g1.current_status
g1.halt
g1.current_status
```

When items are unique and important, we will have a single class that gets instantiated one time.

Other times we are going to create general forms and create multiple instances of them. They are not the same, they have some uniqueness, but they more or less have the same form.

In the example above, all of the guards may be able to stab, or call for help, but they may have unique attributes such as names, heights, and weapons.

#### Classes vs. Instances

* Question: "why create a class for Horacio?"
* Only one Horacio in the play, why do we need to be able to "copy" him?
* Remember in OO -- objects are the key -- they model state and behavior
* The ability to grow and change over time -- i.e. develop throughout the play
* Each play only has 1 Horacio, but he still needs to be able to develop during
the arc of that story
* The next time we tell the story we need to start again -- fresh Horacio, new
development

## Building a Car

Let's think about modeling cars in code. Work through these steps:

1. Create a `Car` class and save it in `car.rb`.
1. At the bottom of the file, outside the class definition, write `my_car = Car.new` to create an instance.
1. Run the file from your terminal with `$ ruby car.rb`. Observe nothing (boohoo!).
1. Add a method to the class named `horn`. In that method return the String `"BEEEEEP!"`. Then at the very bottom of the file add `puts my_car.horn`. If you're using Seeing Is Believing, you can omit the `puts`, that will print it so that you can see it from the terminal, but you don't need to do that if you're using SiB.
1. Run your file again and observe output (yay!).
1. Add a method to your class named `drive` which takes an argument named `distance`. When the method is called, have it return the a string like `I'm driving 12 miles` where `12` is the value passed in for `distance`.
1. Add `puts my_car.drive(12)` to the bottom of your file and run it again. Observe two lines of output (double yay!).
1. Add an `attr_accessor`, an externally-accessible attribute, with the name `color`.
1. Add a method named `report_color` that returns the String `"I am purple"` where `"purple"` is the value stored in `color`.
1. Add two lines to the bottom of the file: `my_car.color = 'purple'` and `puts my_car.report_color`
1. Add an externally-accessible attribute named `wheel_count` and add a line at the bottom setting it to `18`.
1. At the bottom of the file, write a line that prints out `"This sweet ride is sitting on 18 wheels"` where `18` is the value returned from the `wheel_count` method.
1. At the bottom of the file, write a line that creates a second instance of the class Car called, `my_second_car`, and sets the `wheel_count` to `2`. Then write a line that prints "This sweet ride is sitting on 2 wheels". Observer how the two instances have their own instance variables (one car has 18 wheels, the other has 2 wheels, the code is shared through the class, but the variables are stored on the object).
1. This one is tricky. Add a method named `start`. If the car has not yet been started, when the method is called it should return `"Starting up!"`. But if the car has previously been started, it should return `"BZZT! Nice try, though."`. You'll need to create an instance variable, a method, use an if statement, and return a value.

## Homework

Tonight please [complete Part 1 of POODR](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/poodr.markdown).

## Going Further (optional)

If you get done with all of the above, then follow along with [this](https://vimeo.com/137837005) video.
It will go through [this](https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/0facae943f7785e5133ea506595534c1b00b3025/katas/blowing_bubbles_part2.rb) coding exercise.
It builds on bubble sort, but you don't have to understand the algorithm to follow along with it
It only plays with swapping representations, not changing behaviour.
We'll take a piece of top-level procedural code and turn it into a beautiful namespaced object,
and then back again.
