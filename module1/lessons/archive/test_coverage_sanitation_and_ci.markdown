## Learning Goals

* Learn about Test Coverage tools and why they can be useful to your projects
* Learn about Continuous Integration services and why'd you use them
* Learn about tools for evaluating Code Quality

## Structure

* 5 - Warmup
* 25 - Session 1 - Research
* 10 - Session 2 - Test Coverage Expert
* 10 - Session 3 - Continuous Integration Expert
* 10 - Session 4 - Code Quality Expert
* 6 - Session 5 - Gathering Questions
* 18 - Session 6 - Reviewing Questions
* 3 - Wrapup

## Content

Today we're going to try a "jigsaw" approach to exploring three topics across six short sessions.

### Content Areas

Each student will be a part of a Research Group investigating one of the following:

#### Test Coverage with SimpleCov

Learn about SimpleCov and what Test Coverage is all about. Some ideas:

* Find the project on GitHub and check out the readme
* Google for SimpleCov tutorial and see what looks interesting
* This [Turing tutorial](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/measuring_improving_test_coverage.markdown)
* Get it running for any project and observe the output

#### Continuous Integration with Travis CI

* Google to learn about what Continuous Integration is
* Figure out why we use a service rather than just run it on our laptops
* What CI services seem to be popular in the Ruby world?
* What's Travis CI all about? How does it work?
* How do you setup a project on Travis? Get one working to demo.
* What might be tricky about running on CI? Anything different than running on your local machine?
* Why would someone pay for CI?
* Why might a company or project want to run their own CI "in house"?

#### Code Quality

* Find the Readme for the Reek gem
* What is Reek all about? How does it work?
* What kind of quality metrics does Reek use?
* Is Reek just for Ruby code?
* Get it running on one of your projects for a demo
* What kind of "problems" does it find? Do these seem to be legit problems?
* Check out Code Climate
* Set it up for the same project
* Do you get the same feedback?
* Why might you choose Code Climate over Reek, or vice versa?
* Check out thoughtbot's ["Hound" project](https://houndci.com/)
* How does Hound compare to Reek and Code Climate?
* Can you get it running for one of your projects?

### Warmup

For warmup, before you get into your Research Group, spend five minutes getting your feet wet with your research topic.

### Session 1 - Research (25 Minutes)

In this session your goal is to "build expertise". Gather into your "Research Groups" specified in the outline. During this time you're group is collaborating to put together a collection of notes / key understandings such as:

* What is this thing?
* Who makes it / where does it come from?
* Why is it useful?
* Who uses it?
* How do you put it into action?
* How do you get / interpret the results?
* Put together a short demo (less than 3 minutes)
* How can it affect your development process?
* What options might be worth configuring?
* Are there any downsides to using it?
* Where can a person go to learn more about it? Any resources seem better than others?

Each person from the "Research Group" needs to finish session 1 with their own set of notes and their demo ready to go.

### Session 2 - Test Coverage Expert (10 Minutes)

After a short break, we will recombine into your "Learning Groups". You should have one person from each of the Research Groups.

During Session 2, the person from the Test Coverage research group will share their findings. While they're sharing, the rest of the group should:

* Take their own notes
* Ask clarifying questions
* Brainstorm/record any depth questions that the researcher isn't able to answer

Make sure to watch the clock so you each have a good set of notes, understandings, and questions by the end of the session.

### Session 3 - Continuous Integration Expert (10 Minutes)

Repeat the same process with the Continuous Integration researcher sharing their findings.

### Session 4 - Code Quality Expert (10 Minutes)

Repeat the same process with the Code Quality researcher sharing their findings.

### Session 5 - Gathering Questions (6 minutes)

During this short session, one person from each Learning Group should come write their unanswered questions on the front board.

### Session 6 - Reviewing Questions

We'll then review and attempt to answer your questions all together as a group.

### Wrapup

And finally we'll wrap it up with a few review questions.
