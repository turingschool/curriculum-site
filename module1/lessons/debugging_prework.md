## Learning Goals

* Practice independent learning of new concepts
* Become familiar with debugging techniques

## Repository

We'll also be using Erroneous Creatures which is in the Debugging Lesson directory of your [se-mod1-exercises repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/se-mod1-exercises).  You should already have this repository on your computer, but if you do not, fork and clone it down to your local machine.


## Code Along

First, watch [this Async Intro To Debugging video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QyXcx0pqv03igCMaMN_od5Kvnpvf3G4w) and code along in your Erroneous Creatures repo.  Take time to pause and rewind as necessary.
