You'll be using Erroneous Creatures which is in the Debugging Lesson directory of your [se-mod1-exercises repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/se-mod1-exercises).  You should already have this repository on your computer, but if you do not, fork and clone it down to your local machine.
