## Learning Goals

* Identify breaches of academic integrity in the context of Turing

## Warmup

* What does academic integrity mean to you?
* Why is it important here at Turing?
* What does plagiarism look like in the context of software development?
* Provide one example of collaboration for each of the following:
    * supports your learning
    * hinders your learning
    * gray area

## Scenarios

With a partner, review the following scenarios and answer the following questions:

* Would this scenario support your learning?
* Does it make you feel you couldn't present the result as your own work?
* If so, how could you change the scenario so that it would feel like it still resulted in something you could present as your own?

* **Scenario 1:** You pair with a student from an upper mod and they type code into your project that helps you process something you were having difficulty understanding.
* **Scenario 2:** You get stuck on a project and look at the completed project of a student from an upper mod.
* **Scenario 3:** You get stuck on a project and look at the work that a classmate has pushed to their GitHub repository.
* **Scenario 4:** You get stuck on a project and ask a classmate how they've approached a particular aspect of the project.
* **Scenario 5:** You find a snippet of code on StackOverflow that you don't fully understand and use it in your code.
* **Scenario 6:** You copy code that someone else has completed and change some aspects to make it more specific to you.

## Summary

* Are there any common themes? Can we make some rules for ourselves?
