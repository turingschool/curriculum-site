## Learning Goals

- Get exposure to JavaScript syntax
- Get your hands dirty with unfamiliar code
- Just have a little fun!

## Party Plans

We'll use this time to get our hands dirty actually *writing* some code in JavaScript.   This is important practice but should feel like it is low stakes, no pressure, and dare we say....fun!  Be confident, be reckless, do something weird, break stuff.   

Google and the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) will be your friends as you're trying to work with JavaScript.  You might even leverage chatGPT for help if you're stuck and can't find solutions through google and MDN.  Just be sure to struggle through a bit on your own before turning to chatGPT.  And remember, chatGPT often provides info that is very much *not* correct. Ask it for help, not for the answers.

<!-- ## Vocabulary

- <span class="vocab">**Variable:** a piece of data in an Array</span>
- <span class="vocab">**Primitive Data Type:** simple data types in JavaScript are </span>

- <span class="vocab">**Array:** a data type that allows us to store multiple pieces of data in _one_ variable</span>
- <span class="vocab">**Object:** a data type similar to a hash in Ruby</span>

- <span class="vocab">**index position:** the location of an element in an Array</span> -->

## Arrays

Just like Ruby, in JavaScript an **Array** is a data type that allows us to store multiple pieces of data in _one_ variable

Here's an example of an array in JavaScript:
```js
var students = ["Cindy", "Josiah", "Rigo"]
```

Note the similarities between JavaScript and Ruby. Both languages have Arrays and are declared very similarly. The main difference is that JavaScript uses `var` to declare a variable.

Arrays in JS can hold any other data type.  You could have an array of strings, numbers, objects (like hashes in Ruby), or even an array of other arrays.

### Party Game #1

Use this repl to practice working with arrays in JavaScript.  Use google, MDN and each other when you get stuck. You're not suppose to know this, so just have a little fun trying to figure it out.

## Objects (hashes)

Ruby call 'em hashes, JavaScript calls 'em **Objects.**  Just like hashes, an object is a data type that allows us to group related data in various key-value pairs.

Here's an example of an object in JavaScript:
```js
// insert object example
```

Objects in JS can hold any other data type within it's key-value pairs.  You can even declare methods within an object in JS (without having to build an entire Class). 

### Party Game #2

Use this repl to practice working with objects in JavaScript.  Use google, MDN and each other when you get stuck. You're not suppose to know this, so just have a little fun trying to figure it out.
