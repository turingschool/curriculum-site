title: PD Overview
---

Through engaging in and reflecting on a rigorous, collaborative, academic environment, students will inherently continue to develop their self-awareness in this space. Students will also organically use and develop communication and collaboration skills, which will be supported by live sessions (*Giving and Receiving Feedback* and *Learning to Pair*) and group projects which center around how students work together. Students will regularly reflect on their growing professional and technical skills in their *Project Reflections*. Students will engage in a live session on crafting a professional story, and then have a space to workshop their story with peers and staff.

*Students will demonstrate professional readiness to move to Mod 2 by sharing their professional story and reflections on their growth in self-awareness, communication, and collaboration in their Final Portfolio Review.*
