# Debugging Techniques

---

# Warmup

* What are tools we can use to get feedback from our code?

---

# Tools

* `pry`
* `puts`
* Error Messages
* Stack Trace

---

# Demo

* Clone [Erroneous Creatures](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/erroneous_creatures)
* Run the test suite
* Use error messages, `pry`, and `puts` to debug one of the files

---

# Tips

* Read your errors
* Read your stack trace
* Question what you think you know
* Use `pry` and `puts` to investigate

---

# Student Practice

* With a partner, see if you can get the full [Erroneous Creatures](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/erroneous_creatures) test suite to run
