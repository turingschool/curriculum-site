# Number Systems

---

# Warmup

* Deconstruct the number 134. What does the 1 mean? What does the 3 mean? What does the 4 mean?
* What is the significance of increasing the digits in a number? Why do we go from single digit at 9 to double digit at 10?

# Tracking Sheet

Create a chart like the one below to keep track of each number system:

|base|name|digits|max-digit|
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|10||||
|2||||
|16||||
|8||||

# Base-10 (decimal)

* Uses the symbols `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`
* Digits carry over to the next place when `9` becomes `0`
* One digit can represent 10 unique numbers
* Two digits represent 100 unique numbers
* Moving right to left, positions represent:
  * 10^0 = 1
  * 10^1 = 10 ("tens")
  * 10^2 = 100 ("hundreds")
  * 10^3 = 1000 ("thousands")

---

# Base-2 (binary)

* Uses the symbols `0` and `1` only
* Digits carry over to the next place when `1` becomes `0`
* One digit can represent only two unique numbers
* Two digits can represent only four unique numbers
* Moving right to left, positions represent:
  * 2^0 = 1
  * 2^1 = 2
  * 2^2 = 4
  * 2^3 = 8

---

# Base-16 (hexadecimal)

* Uses the symbols `0` through `9` then `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`
* Digits carry over to the next place when `F` becomes `0`
* One digit can represent sixteen unique numbers
* Two digits can represent 256 unique numbers
* Moving right to left, positions represent:
  * 16^0 = 1
  * 16^1 = 16
  * 16^2 = 256
  * 16^3 = 4096

---

# Base-8 (octal)

* Uses the symbols `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, and `7`
* Digits carry over to the next place when `7` becomes `0`
* One digit can represent eight unique numbers
* Two digits can represent 64 unique numbers
* Moving right to left, positions represent:
  * 8^0 = 1
  * 8^1 = 8
  * 8^2 = 64
  * 8^3 = 512
