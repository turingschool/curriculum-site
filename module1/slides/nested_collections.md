# WarmUp

```
animals = {"dogs" => 3, "cats" => 5, "iguanas" => 2}
pet_names = ["Fela", "Spot", "Patch", "Willy"]
```

   * return the count of dogs
   * add 3 parakeets
   * increase the amount of cats by 2
   * add "Claude" to the `pet_names`
   * access which name is first in the list of `pet_names`
   * remove "Fela" from the list of `pet_names`

---

# Nested Arrays

```ruby
numbers = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

* what is `numbers.count`
* what is `numbers.first.count`
* how can I access the element `5`
* how can I add `[7,8,9]` to the numbers array

---

# Hashes within an Array

```
food_feelings = [{:pizza => "tasty"}, {:calzone => "also tasty"}]
```
* what is `food_feelings.count`
* what is `food_feelings.first.count`
* how can I access the element `"also tasty"`
* how can I change `also tasty` to `super delicious`

---

# Hash within a Hash

```
pets = {:dog => {:name => "Chance", :weight => "45 pounds"},
        :cat => {:name => "Sassy", :weight => "15 pounds"}}
```
* what is `pets.count`
* what is `pets.keys`
* what is `pets.values`
* how can I access the element `"15 pounds"`
* how can I add `:age => 3` to the value of the key `:dog`

# Array within a Hash

```
pizza_toppings = {veggies: ["green peppers", "jalape√±o", "mushrooms"],
                  protein: ["pepperoni", "sausage", "sardines"],
                  fruit: ["pineapple"]}
```

* What is `pizza_toppings.count`
* What is `pizza_toppings.values`
* How can I access the element `"pineapple"`
* How can I add the element `"olives"` to they key `"veggies"`
