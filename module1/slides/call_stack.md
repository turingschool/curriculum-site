# Understanding the Call Stack

---

# Warmup

* What is a stack trace?

---

# Data Structures

* Abstract model for organizing data
* Models relationships between data
* Models inserting and accessing data
* Can model other things, for example:
    * searching
    * deleting

---

# Common Data Structures

* Linked List
* Binary Tree
* Graph
* Heap
* Stack

---

# Stacks

* Fundamental Data Structure in computer science
* A Stack is the opposite of a Queue
* Follows "first-in-last-out" semantics
* Important point about a stack: Things on top of the stack cover or hide things on the bottom -- you can't see or access lower elements while there is a top element

---

# Terminology

* __Top__ - Most recently added element (sometimes people will say "bottom" if they are envisioning the stack growing from top down)
* __Pushing__ - adding a new element to the top of the stack
* __Popping__ - removing the top element from the stack

---

# The Call Stack

* Represents each method called as an element on the stack.

# Explorations

See lesson plan.

# Check for Understanding

* What is the Stack data structure? What are the rules of interacting with a Stack?
* What is The Call Stack? How does it work?
* What is a return value, in terms of The Call Stack?
* When an error occurs, how does Ruby create the Stack Trace?
