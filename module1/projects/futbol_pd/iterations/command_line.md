title: Build a Command Line Interface

_[Back to Futbol Home](../index)_

Now that we have an object that provides us with methods that we can use to analyze this data, we'd like to present it to people in a way they can understand without having to know how to code.

At a high level what we'd like to do is create a command line interface that would allow a user to interact with our StatTracker class by typing `ruby stats.rb` and then entering responses to questions posed by the computer to get more data.

It's up to you to determine what specific questions you would like your program to ask and how specifically you'd like to display the information, but a user should be able to access all of the information you've amassed in previous iterations.
