## Retrospective

The group should perform a retrospective (often just called "retro"). There are many ways to do a project retro and lots of tools we can use to facilitate them. A quick Google search will yield dozens of links to resources about how, why, when, etc. as well as tools you can use to facilitate a retro.

Here are some links to get you started:
* [Retrospectives by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective)
* [How to run an effective project retrospective meeting](https://www.smarttask.io/blog/project-retrospective-meeting)
* [ How to run a retrospective by Mural](https://www.mural.co/blog/sprint-retrospective)

For this iteration, research how to run a retro. Collectively decide on a method and then do it!

You should plan to discuss a summary of your retro during your project presentation. Here are some ideas of ways you can talk about it during the eval:
* What formats did the group consider?
* Why did you choose the format you did?
* Did this retro feel effective? What might you try differently the next time you run a group retro?
* Summarize the outcome of the retro.


## Deliverables
In addition to giving a summary of your retro during the evaluation, AFTER you do your retro, add to your README:

* The name of and links (if applicable) to any tools you used for retro
* Top 3 things that went well during your project
* Top 3 things your team would do differently next time

If you used a format for your retro that didn't include what went well and what you would change, you can adjust bullet points 2 and 3 accordingly.
