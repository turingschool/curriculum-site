For this project, you will have a live evaluation over Zoom with an instructor. You and your group are expected to prepare a presentation to speak to each of the top-level topics listed below. Every member of the group is expected to speak during the presentation. Each top-level topic (has a check box) should be discussed. The bullet points below each topic are provided for ideas and guidance as things you can talk about. You do NOT need to address every single bullet point, just every topic. If you have any  questions, please let your instructor know before the project submission deadline.


## Presentation Topics:

[ ] Discuss Project Management process
 * What tool(s) did you use for managing tasks and assignments
 * What worked well and not so well about this process?
 * Did anything about this process change mid-project? If so, how did that change come about? For example, how was this issue approached and a change decided upon by the group?

[ ] Review Git Workflow
  * Show an example of a PR with lots of team collaboration and discussion
  * Did you have any rules or guidelines in place to ensure effective workflow?
  * What was challenging about working with 3-5 people on one repository?

[ ] Collaboration & Communication
 * Describe how feedback was shared amongst team members.
 * Did the team ever meet with the intention of solving a non-technical problem? For example, to discuss a change to a process. Were these meetings ad hoc or regularly scheduled? If you could do it over again, would you have changed how you approached non-technical communication with your team?
 * Were there any pieces of the DTR that needed to be re-visited mid-project due to something not working out as expected?
 * Give a summary of your Retro. What formats did the group consider? Why did you choose the format you did? Did this retro feel effective? What might you try differently the next time you run a group retro? Summarize the outcome of the retro.

[ ] Technical Review - **All of the list items below are required**, however each talking point can be brief.
 * Run the test suite and show the coverage report
 * Demonstrate the functionality of the project (show how it works). You can use a runner file to demonstrate a few of the statistics that can be calculated.
 * Technical design: At a high level (not line by line), describe how you broke out this application, and describe why you chose to design your code in this way.
