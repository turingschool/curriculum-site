For this project, you will submit your project with a robust README document for an asynchronous evaluation. 

Before you turn in the project, you and your group should be prepared to answer the questions in the checklist below. If you have any questions, please let your instructor know before the project submission deadline.

## Evaluation readiness checklist:

[ ] Demonstration of functional completeness
 * Display to the viewer the ability to start the program via the runner file, and demonstrate a few of the statistics that can be calculated.

[ ] Technical quality and organization of the code
 * At a high level (not line by line), describe how you broke out this application. What classes did you create? What is the responsibility of each class? Why did you choose to design your code in this way?
 * Is there a design decision that you made that you're particularly proud of?
 * Did you use inheritence and/or modules in your project? Why did you choose to use one over the other?
 * Were you able to implement a hash at some point in your project? If so, where? And why did you choose to use a hash instead of another data type?

[ ] Identifying areas of code that you decided to refactor
 * How did you identify areas of code to refactor? At a high level, how did you go about refactoring?
 * Are there other areas of your code that you still wish to refactor?

[ ] Discussion of collaboration/version control
 * What was your collaboration like in this group project? How was it different working in a larger group compared to pairs?
 * Were there any tools that you used to make collaboration easier?

[ ] Discussion of test coverage
 * Run your test suite and open the coverage report from SimpleCov.
 * Show examples of unit and integration tests that you wrote.
 * Run the Spec Harness.
 * What was it like using the Spec Harness for this project? How did it inform your design or testing choices?
