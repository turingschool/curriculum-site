Black Thursday
===============

A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

Project Overview
-----------------

### Learning Goals

*   Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
*   Decompose a large application into components
*   Design a solution that is functional, readable, maintainable, and testable
*   Learn an agile approach to building software

### Key Concepts

From a technical perspective, this project will emphasize:

*   File I/O
*   Database Operations (CRUD)
*   Encapsulating Responsibilities
*   Light data / analytics

### Getting Started

1.  One team member forks the repository [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/black_thursday) and adds the other(s) as collaborators.
1.  Everyone on the team clones the repository
1.  Setup [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to monitor test coverage along the way
1.  Setup [Hound CI](https://houndci.com/)


### Spec Harness

This project will be assessed with the help of a [spec harness](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness).
A spec harness is a working test suite that helps to assess the requirements of a project, but does not include any application logic of its own. Note: the spec harness **is not** a replacement for your own test suite; you are still required to use TDD to complete your application.

The spec harness [README.md file](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness) includes instructions for setup and usage.

### Project Iterations and Base Expectations

Because the requirements for this project are lengthy and complex, we've broken them into Iterations in their own files. Your project *must* implement iterations 0 through 4. Iteration 5 is the Undiscovered Country.

*   [Iteration 0](./iteration_0) - Merchants & Items
*   [Iteration 1](./iteration_1) - Beginning Relationships and Business Intelligence
*   [Iteration 2](./iteration_2) - Basic Invoices
*   [Iteration 3](./iteration_3) - Item Sales
*   [Iteration 4](./iteration_4) - Merchant Analytics
*   [Iteration 5](./iteration_5) - Customer Analytics


## Evaluation Rubric

Your project will be assessed using [this rubric](./rubric).
