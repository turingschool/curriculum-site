## Peer Code Review

With your partner, please answer the following questions.  Take notes and share those notes with your partner.

1. Review the `number_correct` method on the Round class:
    * Discuss the decisions you made to either store this information as an instance variable, or calculate the number any time the method is called.
    * What are some pros and cons to each approach?
1. Review the `percent_correct_by_category` on the Round class:
    * Can you identify major differences in each approach to the implementation?
    * Discuss the scalability of each approach.
1. Review each persons CLI:
    * Are your runner files similar or different?
    * What are some pros and cons to each person's approach?
1. Review each others code from a design perspective.
    * Does anything stick out as particularly readable, or well-designed?
    * Where are there areas for improvement in design or readability?
1. Compare each other git history (this will be easiest to do by reviewing the commits/branches on GitHub)
    * What did you find most challenging about using git/GitHub?
1. Review the tests that your partner wrote for the `take_turn` method.
    * Is the method well tested?
    * Provide feedback on aspects of the test(s) that are particularly good, and provide constructive feedback on how the test(s) could be improved.
1. Discuss what you each found most difficult about the project.
1. Discuss what you each are proudest of from this project.
