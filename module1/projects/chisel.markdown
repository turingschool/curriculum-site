## Before You Begin

This project is going to center on Markdown and HTML. If you don't have
experience with those two technologies it'll be hard to really understand how
to construct/implement your code.

If you'd like to build just enough familiarity, try these resource:

* [Codecademy's HTML and CSS Track](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) focusing on the "HTML Basics" all the way up to but not including "CSS: An Overview"
* This [Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/)

## Introduction

HTML is an amazing tool for marking up documents, but it's not very fun for
writing content.

Several years ago, John Gruber proposed [the idea of Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). It's a style of
text formatting that's less obtrusive than writing HTML, is easy to remember,
and is highly readable even when not converted to HTML. Here's an example:

```plain
# My Life in Desserts

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

"You just *have* to try the cheesecake," he said. "Ever since it appeared in
**Food & Wine** this place has been packed every night."
```

Using a *markdown parser*, we could convert that example *markdown document* into the following
chunk of HTML:

```html
<h1>My Life in Desserts</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>

<p>"You just <em>have</em> to try the cheesecake," he said. "Ever since it appeared in <strong>Food & Wine</strong> this place has been packed every night."</p>
```

### Experimenting with Markdown

There are markdown parsers available for just about every language you can
imagine. In the Ruby world some of the best known are Redcarpet, Rdiscount, and
RedCloth.

Let's experiment with RedCarpet. Start by installing the gem:

```
$ gem install redcarpet
```

Then let's start IRB and load the gem:

```
$ irb
> require 'redcarpet'
```

Now we can use redcarpet from a pry session to render the snippet of markdown we looked at before:

```ruby
renderer = Redcarpet::Render::HTML.new
engine = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(renderer)
markdown_source = "# My Life in Desserts\n\n## Chapter 1: The Beginning\n\n\"You just *have* to try the cheesecake,\" he said. \"Ever since it appeared in **Food & Wine** this place has been packed every night.\""
engine.render(markdown_source)
=> "<h1>My Life in Desserts</h1>\n\n<h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>\n\n<p>&quot;You just <em>have</em> to try the cheesecake,&quot; he said. &quot;Ever since it appeared in <strong>Food &amp; Wine</strong> this place has been packed every night.&quot;</p>\n"
```

During this project, we'll be building a simple markdown parser that performs some of the functions of Redcarpet!

As you work, it will sometimes be useful to use Redcarpet to check your work by validating that your code handles a chunk
of markdown the same way it does.

## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Test components in isolation and in combination
* Apply Enumerable techniques in a real context
* Read text from and write text to files

## Base Expectations

### An Interaction Model

We're going to use Chisel from the command line, reading in Markdown
files and writing out HTML. It'll go like this:

```bash
$ ruby ./lib/chisel.rb my_input.markdown my_output.html
Converted my_input.markdown (6 lines) to my_output.html (8 lines)
```

Where `my_input.markdown` is a file like this:

```plain
# My Life in Desserts

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

"You just *have* to try the cheesecake," he said. "Ever since it appeared in
**Food & Wine** this place has been packed every night."
```

And the resulting `my_output.html` would contain the following:

```html
<h1>My Life in Desserts</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>

<p>
  "You just <em>have</em> to try the cheesecake," he said. "Ever since it appeared in
  <strong>Food &amp; Wine</strong> this place has been packed every night."
</p>
```

Got it?

### Restrictions

* Don't use any regular expressions
* Only use existing parsers to generate sample output or to validate your output

### Expected Functionality

Parsing Markdown is a good application of spiraling design. As such, your
expected functionality is broken down into levels. But *all* of these
levels should be completed in order to earn full marks.

#### Level 1 - Text Basics

A chunk of text is defined as one or more lines of content which does not
contain any blank lines. For example, this is one chunk of text:

##### Paragraphs

By default, a free-standing line of text in a markdown document will go into a `<p>` tag.
For example, this text:

```plain
This is the first line of the paragraph.
```

Would be rendered as:

```html
<p>This is the first line of the paragraph.</p>
```

Additionally, lines separated by a **single line break** remain part of the same paragraph.
For example this markdown:

```plain
This is the first line of the paragraph.
This is the second line of the same paragraph.
```

Becomes:

```html
<p>This is the first line of the paragraph. This is the second line of the same paragraph.</p>
```

If we want to create multiple paragraphs, we need to insert 2 line breaks to separate the lines:

```plain
This is the first line of the first paragraph.

This is the first line of the second paragraph.
```

Becomes:

```html
<p>This is the first line of the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the first line of the second paragraph.</p>
```

##### Headers

The other basic text entity we'll support is the **header**. Headers are used in documents to indicate
a headline in large text. HTML supports different levels of header tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.

In markdown, we create a header with some number of `#` signs (corresponding to the header level) followed
by the text for the header.

For example:

```plain
## Here's an H2
```

Becomes

```html
<h2>Here's an H2</h2>
```

Note that unlike paragraphs, markdown headers only contain one line. So this:

```
# Header
followed by text
```

Becomes:

```html
<h1>Header</h1>
<p>followed by text</p>
```

And:

```
## Header 1
## Header 2
```

Becomes:

```html
<h2>Header 1</h2>
<h2>Header 2</h2>
```

##### Requirements

Build up your Chisel so it supports:

* A chunk of text starting with `#`, `##`, `###`, `####`, or `#####` is turned
into an HTML header (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) with the header level corresponding to the
number of `#` symbols
* A chunk of text *not* starting with `#` is turned into a paragraph

#### Level 2 - Formatting

With Level 1 completed, move on to Level 2:

* Within either a header or a paragraph, any word or words wrapped in `*` should
be enclosed in `<em>` tags
* Within either a header or a paragraph, any word or words wrapped in `**` should
be enclosed in `<strong>` tags

Make sure to consider scenarios like this: `My *emphasized and **stronged** text* is awesome.`

#### Level 3 - Lists

Often in writing we want to create unordered (bullet) or ordered (numbered) lists.
Build support for **unordered lists** like this:

```plain
My favorite cuisines are:

* Sushi
* Barbeque
* Mexican
```

Which should output:

```html
<p>
  My favorite cuisines are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sushi</li>
  <li>Barbeque</li>
  <li>Mexican</li>
</ul>
```

Then build support for **ordered lists** which use numbers for the markers.
Though, confusingly, the numbers themselves don't matter. Some authors use `1.`
to mark every list element and let the HTML renderer (aka browser) figure things out:

```plain
My favorite cuisines are:

1. Sushi
2. Barbeque
3. Mexican
```

Which is turned into:

```html
<p>
  My favorite cuisines are:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sushi</li>
  <li>Barbeque</li>
  <li>Mexican</li>
</ol>
```

## Extensions

If you finish all the base expectations, consider implementing two of these extensions:

### Images

Add support for images, both with and without the optional title attribute. Don't implement the Reference-Style Links. [See the specification](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#img)

### Blocks & Blockquotes

Add support for both [Blockquotes](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#blockquote) and [Code Blocks](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode).

### Links

At this point you're familiar with the basics of how Markdown works. Go
[straight to the source to see how HTML links should work](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link). You do not need to implement the "Reference-Style Links", just the normal inline ones.

### Reference-Style Links

Revisit the documentation about Links and build up support for the reference-style links it describes.

### Reverse Chisel

Can you implement a reverser which takes in HTML and outputs Markdown?

This extension is quite hard, so it counts double.
