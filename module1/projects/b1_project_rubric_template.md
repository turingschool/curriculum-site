## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Functional Expectations
<!-- (this section is likely different for projects with iterations laid out) -->
* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.

### 5. Desktop Environment
<!-- (only relevant for pairing) -->
* 4: Student uses keyboard shortcuts to minimize distractions, and is largely able to navigate their machine without using their mouse.
* 3: Student is able to efficiently navigate their machine, but may sometimes use their mouse or look at their keyboard.
* 2: Student does not implement code at pace due to struggles with their desktop environment.
* 1: Student does not demonstrate that they fully understand the relationship between the command line, their text editor, and the file browser.

### 6. Debugging
<!-- (only relevant for pairing) -->
* 4: Student uses pry, `puts`, and error messages to get feedback from the system, and can use this feedback to fix errors.
* 3: Student uses debugging tools like pry, or `puts`, but may need some help to identify issues.
* 2: Student uses debugging tools only when prompted on multiple occassions.
* 1: Student does not demonstrate that they are able to use debugging tools even when prompted.

### 7. Code Sanitation
<!--  (doesn't apply to all projects, but a good spot for project-specific rubric requirements) -->
The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints  

### 8. Version Control  
<!--  (doesn't apply to all projects, but a good spot for project-specific rubric requirements) -->  
* 4: Student demonstrates strong git workflow, commits frequently to document progress, uses commits to identify added functionality, and utilizes pull requests for communication and feedback  
* 3: Student utilizes git workflow essentials, committing frequently to document progress
* 2: Student adds and commits infrequently and pushes project to GitHub  
* 1: Student makes an initial commit and pushes project to GitHub  

### 9. Collaboration
<!-- (only relevant for pairing) -->
* 4: Student discusses pros and cons of different approaches and solicits input
* 3: Student lays out their thinking while working through a problem and integrates feedback throughout the process
* 2: Student asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
* 1: Student is able to integrate unsolicited feedback but does not really collaborate
