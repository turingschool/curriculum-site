## Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Distinguishing between classes and instances of those classes
* Use and implement iteration or recursion techniques
* Host code on Github


## Evaluation Preparation
1. Be prepared to share your screen with your Beat Box project open in your text editor.
2. Be prepared to share your tests.
3. Be prepared to talk about parts of your code you're proud of, and parts of your code you would like to refactor if you had more time.
4. Be prepared to ask any questions you might have.

<br> | **Exceeds Expectations** | **Meets Expectations** | **Approaching Expectations** | **Below Expectations**
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | Complete both extensions of iteration 4. | Complete through Iteration 3 and functions as defined by the project requirements. | Up to Iteration 2 is complete or the application does not exactly follow the requirements outlined in the specification. | Iteration 2 is not complete. |
**Ruby Mechanics** | Project includes appropriate uses of datatypes and methods not covered in class | Appropriately uses Ruby's built in datatypes and methods and flow control. | Does not appropriately use one or two of the following: Ruby's built in datatypes and methods or flow control | Does not appropriately use Ruby's built in datatypes and methods or flow control, or does not build classes |
**Ruby Conventions** | Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. | Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention | Code demonstrates some proper indenting and spacing. Class, method, variable, and file names inconsistently follow convention | Code is not properly indented and spaced and lines are excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names do not follow convention |
**Testing** | All methods are accurately tested. Best use assertions are made. Edge cases are tested. | Each class has its own test file. Every method listed on the specification is tested. Most tests are written to accurately verify expected behavior. | Tests are written for most methods listed on the specification, but the tests may be in an incorrect location or the tests may not accurately verify the expected behavior | Fewer than 7 tests written |
**Version Control** | At least 30 commits. At least 3 pull requests. Commit messages and Pull Request documentation clearly indicate changes made. | Code is hosted on main branch of Github repository. At least 20 commits. At least 1 pull request. | Code is hosted on Github, but has fewer than 20 commits or has no pull requests | Code is not hosted on Github |
