## Extensions
### Option 1
Find your own data set to work with and do something interesting with it. If you choose this option, check in with an instructor before starting.
  * Here's a good place to start your data hunt: [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset)


### Option 2
Calculate some analytics about your existing data sets:
  * EV Registrations:
    * Find the most popular make/model registered
    * Count of registered vehicle for a model year
    * County with most registered vehicles

  * Facilities:
    * Add in a few more helpful attributes.
      * What are the daily hours for each facility?
      * For the states that provide (Missouri), which holidays are they closed?

  * Vehicles:
    * Add in a second data source for vehicles and create some `Vehicle` objects from NY State Registration Data: https://data.ny.gov/resource/w4pv-hbkt.json
