## Evaluation Rubric

<br> | **Exceeds Expectations** | **Meets Expectations** | **Approaching Expectations** | **Below Expectations**
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | 1 of the options in Iteration 4 is complete | All of the functionality in Iteration 3 is complete | Some of the functionality in Iteration 3 is not complete | Iteration 2 is not complete |
**Object Oriented Programming** | Project adheres to SRP. Methods are well factored to include the use of helpers and code is DRY, likely through the use of concepts not yet taught in class. | Project correctly uses classes to create `Vehicle` and `Facility` objects from outside data as specified. The same `Facility` class is used for multiple data sources.  | Project uses classes to create `Vehicle` and `Facility` objects from outside data but may rely on unnecessary additional classes. | Project does not use `Vehicle` or `Facility` classes effectively for creating objecst from the provided data sources. |
**Ruby Conventions** | Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. | Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention | Code demonstrates some proper indenting and spacing. Class, method, variable, and file names inconsistently follow convention | Code is not properly indented and spaced and lines are excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names do not follow convention |
**Test Driven Development** | All methods (including helpers) are unit and integration tested. All tests accurately verify expected behavior. | No more than 2 tests fail to accurately verify expected behavior. All methods (including helpers) are unit and integration tested. | Every method does not include a test. More than 2 tests fail to accurately verify expected behavior. | Half the methods are not tested or have tests that do not accurately verify expected behavior |
**Version Control** | Minimum 40 commits and 4 pull requests. All pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. Fewer than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.	|  Minimum 30 commits and 3 pull requests. More than half of your pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request.	| Minimum 20 commits and 2 pull requests. At least half of your pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality. 	 | Less than 20 commits or 2 pull requests.
