## Peer Code Share

You will pair up with another person to review each other's code and provide feedback.

First, exchange Github repo links with the other person.

Then, take 25 minutes to review the other person's code. You should write down answers to the following questions:

1. Did you solve the bugs from Iteration 1 in the same way? What was different in your approach?
1. What classes and methods did the other team include that were not described in the project? How do these classes help organize the code? Are there additional classes or methods they could consider adding that might improve their code?
1. Is there anything your partner did that you had not thought to try?
1. What other feedback do you have for the other person?
1. What other questions do you have for the other person?

Once both people have finished reviewing code, set up a 40 meeting with each other. During that meeting, both people should share their answers to the questions above.
