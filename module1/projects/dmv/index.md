## Background
Recently, the Department of Motor Vehicles hired a software developer to help build a new program to manage the services they offer and process some data. Unfortunately, they didn't hire a Turing grad, and the job is incomplete. Thankfully, you're here to help carry this project through to the end.

## Learning Goals

* Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Host code on Github and use Pull Requests
* Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
* Work with an existing codebase
* Manipulate data from external sources

## Overview

 When we get hired for a new job, the vast majority of us will be working with existing code for a project already in production (which means it's live on the internet for people to use). It will probably have some bugs that need to be fixed, inefficiencies in the code, as well as new features to be built. One of the purposes of this project is to practice the skill of onboarding to an existing project. You'll also practice using Ruby to build out some new functionality for The Department of Motor Vehicles. More detail can be found in the pages below:

* [Requirements](./requirements)
* [Peer Code Share](./peer_code_share)

* [Evaluation Rubric](./rubric)
