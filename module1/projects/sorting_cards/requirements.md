title: SortingCards - Requirements
---

In order to help you to organize your project, we have broken the requirements into four separate iterations. It is expected that you will complete iterations 1-3, while 4 includes extensions that represent opportunities to further explore.

* [Iteration 1](./iteration_1)
* [Iteration 2](./iteration_2)
* [Iteration 3](./iteration_3)
* [Iteration 4](./iteration_4)
