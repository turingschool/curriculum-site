# Iteration 2 - Access and Analysis: High School Graduation

Now that we have the pieces working for a single CSV file of Kindergarteners, let's add some more data to the equation in Interaton 1.

## `EnrollmentRepository` and High School Graduation Data

Return to the `EnrollmentRepository` to add support for a second data file:

```ruby
er = EnrollmentRepository.new
er.load_data({
  :enrollment => {
    :kindergarten => "./data/Kindergartners in full-day program.csv",
    :high_school_graduation => "./data/High school graduation rates.csv"
  }
})
enrollment = er.find_by_name("ACADEMY 20")
# => <Enrollment>
```

Then on that `Enrollment` instance let's add the following data access methods:

### `#graduation_rate_by_year`

This method returns a hash with years as keys and a truncated three-digit floating point number representing a percentage.

*Example*:

```ruby
enrollment.graduation_rate_by_year
=> { 2010 => 0.895,
     2011 => 0.895,
     2012 => 0.889,
     2013 => 0.913,
     2014 => 0.898,
     }
```

### `#graduation_rate_in_year(year)`

This method takes one parameter:

* `year` as an integer for any year reported in the data

A call to this method with any unknown `year` should return `nil`.

The method returns a truncated three-digit floating point number representing a percentage.

*Example*:

```ruby
enrollment.graduation_rate_in_year(2010) # => 0.895
```

## Analysis

For this additional data there aren't any new relationships to construct, so let's jump right into the analysis.

### How does kindergarten participation variation compare to the high school graduation variation?

There's thinking that kindergarten participation has long-term effects. Given our limited data set, let's *assume* that variance in kindergarten rates for a given district is similar to when current high school students were kindergarten age (~10 years ago). Let's compare the variance in kindergarten participation and high school graduation.

For a single district:

```ruby
ha.kindergarten_participation_against_high_school_graduation('ACADEMY 20') # => 1.234
```

Call *kindergarten variation* the result of dividing the district's kindergarten participation by the statewide average. Call *graduation variation* the result of dividing the district's graduation rate by the statewide average. Divide the *kindergarten variation* by the *graduation variation* to find the *kindergarten-graduation variance*.

If this result is close to `1`, then we'd infer that the *kindergarten variation* and the *graduation variation* are closely related.

### Does Kindergarten participation predict high school graduation?

Let's consider the `#kindergarten_participation_against_high_school_graduation` and set a correlation window between `0.6` and `1.5`. If the result is in that range then we'll say that they are correlated. For a single district:

```ruby
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_high_school_graduation(for: 'ACADEMY 20')
# => true
```

Then let's look statewide. If more than 70% of districts across the state show a correlation, then we'll answer `true`. If it's less than `70%` we'll answer `false`.

```ruby
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_high_school_graduation(:for => 'STATEWIDE') # => true
```

Then let's do the same calculation across a subset of districts:

```ruby
ha.kindergarten_participation_correlates_with_high_school_graduation(
  :across => ['district_1', 'district_2', 'district_3', 'district_4']) # => true
```
