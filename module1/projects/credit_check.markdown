### Learning Goals
* Break a problem into logical components
* Implement appropriate Ruby syntax
* Utilize methods and classes

Let's write a program that can detect mistakes in a credit card number.

## Background: Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn algorithm is a check-summing algorithm best known for checking the validity of credit card numbers.

You can checkout the full description on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

### Description

(adapted from Wikipedia)

The formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial account number to generate the full account number. This full account number must pass the following test:

* starting with the first digit, double the value of every other digit
* if the product of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 7 * 2 = 14), then sum the digits of the products (e.g., 10: 1 + 0 = 1, 14: 1 + 4 = 5).
* take the sum of all the digits
* if the sum is divisible by ten, the number is valid

### Example

#### Validating an Account Number

Using `5541808923795240` as our sample input:

```
Account number:        5    5    4    1    8    0    8    9    2    3    7    9    5    2    4    0
2x every other digit:  10   5    8    1    16   0    16   9    4    3    14   9    10   2    8    0
Summed digits over 10: 1    5    8    1    7    0    7    9    4    3    5    9    1    2    8    0
Results summed:        70
Divisible by 10?:      70 % 10 == 0
```

Since the summed results modulo 10 is zero, the account number is valid according to the algorithm.

## Assignment

### Setup

1. Fork [this Repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/credit_check)
1. Clone your forked repo to your machine with `git clone <ssh key for your repo>`

### Iteration 1 - The Luhn Algorithm

Open `credit_check.rb` in your `lib` directory. You should see this template:

```ruby
card_number = "5541808923795240"

# Your Luhn Algorithm Here

# Output
## If it is valid, print "The number [card number] is valid!"
## If it is invalid, print "The number [card number] is invalid!"
```

Fill out the file so that it will print out the validity of the given card_number. The number included in the template is a valid example.

#### Sample Data

If helpful, you can use the following sample data:

* *Valid*: 5541808923795240, 4024007136512380, 6011797668867828
* *Invalid*: 5541801923795240, 4024007106512380, 6011797668868728

### Iteration 2 - Credit Card Class

Create a `CreditCheck` class based on the following criteria:

* A `CreditCheck` is passed two arguments upon initialization
  * The first argument is a String representing the card number
  * The second argument is an Integer representing the `CreditCheck`'s limit
* A `CreditCheck` has getter methods called `card_number` and `limit` for reading the card number and limit
* A `CreditCheck` has a method called `is_valid?` that takes no arguments and returns either true or false based on whether or not the card number is valid.
* A `CreditCheck` has a method called `last_four` that returns a String of the last four digits of the card number

If the previous criteria are met, you should be able to interact with the `CreditCheck` class from a Pry session like so:

```ruby

pry(main)> require './lib/credit_check'
#=> true

pry(main)> credit_check = CreditCheck.new("5541808923795240", 15000)
#=> #<CreditCheck:0x00007fbb1ca5f698 @card_number="5541808923795240", @limit=15000>

pry(main)> credit_check.card_number
#=> "5541808923795240"

pry(main)> credit_check.limit
#=> 15000

pry(main)> credit_check.last_four
#=> "5240"

pry(main)> credit_check.is_valid?
#=> true
```

Also, if the previous criteria are met, the `bank_test.rb` test should pass.

### Iteration 3 - Testing

Write tests for your `CreditCheck` class that cover that expected behavior described in the previous iteration.

To run the tests already written, you'll need to first install RSpec, our testing gem, by running this in your terminal:
`gem instal rspec`

Then to run the tests, you'll type: `rspec spec/bank_spec.rb` in your terminal.

### Iteration 4 - Extensions

* Create a command line interface that allows the user to validate a number

* Add functionality to calculate the check sum digit.

* Can you make it work for American Express numbers? 342804633855673 is valid but 342801633855673 is invalid
