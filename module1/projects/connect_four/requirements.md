title: Connect Four - Requirements

_[Back to Connect Four Home](./index)_

The specifications give you ideas for some classes to help you start breaking this problem down, but you will also have to create some additional classes and methods to build an Object-Oriented solution to this problem. This means that there should be very little code outside of a class and you are using your classes to create objects that interact in some way.

Additionally, this project will require you to use Test Driven Development for all methods that do not **rely** on user input. *Very few* methods should rely on user input.

As a pair, you are both expected to commit frequently and use Pull Requests to merge your code with your partner's. Remember that there are many ways to contribute to a group effort - review the topics we discussed in your [Learning to Pair](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SB65R2PkUBHoNHk3z5Q71D-ZVHPLdQ7wBagGjd6_AUU/edit?usp=sharing) lesson. 

Please read the [Rubric](./rubric) before getting started so that you know what is expected of you.
