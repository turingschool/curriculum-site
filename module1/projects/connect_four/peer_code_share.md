## Peer Code Share

You and your partner will team up with another pair to review each other's code and provide feedback.

First, exchange Github repo links with the other team.

Then, with your project partner, take 25 minutes to review the other team's code. You should write down answers to the following questions:

1. Can you play the game? Is it easy to figure out how to play the game? Do you find any bugs as you play?
1. Discuss the code for the endgame conditions (`Player Wins`, `Computer Wins`, `Draw`). Is the logic easy to follow? Do the variable names make sense? Could this method be improved by creating additional helper methods?
* In the case that the other team did not write code for endgame conditions, discuss the code for the player and computer selecting a valid column. Answer the same questions above.
1. What classes and methods did the other team include that were not described in the project? How do these classes help organize the code? Are there additional classes or methods they could consider adding that might improve their code?
1. What other feedback do you have for the other team?
1. What other questions do you have for the other team?

Once both teams have finished reviewing code, set up a 40 meeting with the other team. During that meeting, both teams should share their answers to the questions above.
