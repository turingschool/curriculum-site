## Learning Goals

* Follow an interaction pattern
* Write readable code that adheres to Ruby convention
* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
* Host code on Github

<br>

<br> | **Exceptional** | **Meets Expectations** | **Below Expectations** | **Well Below Expectations**
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | Application is robust and can handle a variety of inputs including invalid inputs and completes iteration 4 | Application adheres to the flow outlined in the specification and can handle a variety of valid inputs (not just what is outlined in spec). Iteration 3 is complete. | Only up to Iteration 2 is complete or the application does not follow the flow outlined in the specification. | Iteration 2 is not complete. |
**Ruby Mechanics** | Project includes appropriate uses of hashes and enumerables not covered in class | Appropriately uses Ruby's built in datatypes and methods, flow control, and enumerables. | Does not appropriately use one or two of the following: Ruby's built in datatypes and methods, flow control, and enumerables | Does not appropriately use Ruby's built in datatypes and methods, flow control, and enumerables, or does not build classes |
**Ruby Conventions** | Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. | Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention | Code demonstrates some proper indenting and spacing. Class, method, variable, and file names inconsistently follow convention | Code is not properly indented and spaced and lines are excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names do not follow convention |
**Testing** | All methods that do not require command line input/output are accurately tested. Best use assertions are made. | Each class has its own test file. Every method listed on the specification is tested. Most tests are written to accurately verify expected behavior. | Tests are written for most methods listed on the specification, but the tests may be in an incorrect location or the tests may not accurately verify the expected behavior | Fewer than 7 tests written (in addition to the card tests provided) |

## Version Control
Code is required to be hosted on a GitHub repository, and will have at least 20 commits and one pull request.
