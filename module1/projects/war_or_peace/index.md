* Write tests
* Create an Object Oriented Solution to a problem (objects should interact to achieve the stated goal)
* Host code on Github and submit a Pull Request

## Overview

In this project, you will write a program to simulate a game of [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). A user will be able to create two players, and watch them 'play' the game.

In order to build good habits, we've broken the project into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.
