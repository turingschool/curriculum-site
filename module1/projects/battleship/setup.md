## Repository Setup

Because this is a paired project, you will want to choose one person to create the project repository and invite the other person as a collaborator using the following steps:

* Person A will create a git repository and link it to a GitHub repository.
* Person A will add Person B as a collaborator to the repository:
    * From the GitHub Repository main page, click on `settings`
    * In the left nav bar, click on `Collaborators`
    * Search for a user and click `Add Collaborator`
* Person B will get an email invite to join the project as a collaborator.
    * Click on the link in the email and accept the invitation.
    * Clone the repository to your local machine.

Once this setup is complete, both partners will be able to push to the GitHub repository, create Pull Requests and Merge the Pull Requests.
