## Background
Battleship is a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board, and then take turns trying to "sink" the other player's ships by guessing their coordinates. The game ends when one player's ships are all hit and "sunk".
For more information, see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

## Learning Goals

* Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Practice algorithmic thinking
* Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
* Work in a pair, using Pull Requests to collaborate
