## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring. Code is consistently clear and makes excellent use of common ruby patterns and idioms.
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization and refactoring but still has some long or difficult-to-read methods. Some ruby idioms or patterns could still be applied more consistently.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application completes all required iterations and adds comparable feature(s) of its own design
* 3: Application completes all features in Iterations 0-5
* 2: Application completes at least iterations 0-3
* 1: Application does not complete iterations 0-3

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-6
