## Iteration 6 - Supporting Feature #2

Choose one of the following supporting features to add. Additional features will be considered extensions.

### Supporting more file types

Choose one of the following translations to add

* [Haml](http://haml.info/) => HTML
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) => CSS


### Publish to github pages

Create a publish script that will publish your website to [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

Running:

```
bin/hyde publish
```

will build and publish that build to github pages. Then you should be able to visit your site index from the browser at a URL kind of like this one:

```
github_username.github.io/hyde
```

Ensure your `index.md` has relative links to your posts and pages so you can view them.

Your source files should not be viewable on your github pages site
