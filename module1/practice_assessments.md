## Practice Mid Mod

Instructions:
* The Mid Mod will follow the same format as other IC's throughout the mod.
* For the Mid Mod, no tests will be provided. You will be expected to TDD all work (which means creating all `_spec.rb` files and corresponding `.rb` files).

Example Paired Assessment:
* [Pets and Customers](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/tree/main/practice_independent_challenges/week3/pets_and_customers):
  * [Iterations 1 - 2](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week3/pets_and_customers/interations_1_and_2.md)
  * Iterations 3 - 4 (choose your own adventure):
    * Option 1: [Groomer](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week3/pets_and_customers/groomer.md)
    * Option 2: [Day Care](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week3/pets_and_customers/day_care.md)
    * Option 3: [Veterinary Clinic](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week3/pets_and_customers/veterinary_clinic.md)

## Practice Independent Challenges

**Week 2**

The week 2 challenge is an intro to Object Oriented Programming. It will require students to build two classes that interact, as well as use an enumerable.

Example: [Potluck](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/tree/main/practice_independent_challenges/week2/potluck)

**Week 3**

In addition to the Practice MidMod above, student can practice with the IC below.

Example: [World Cup](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week3/world_cup)

**Week 4**

The week 4 challenge will involve three classes with only partial specifications. Students must think algorithmically to build an Object Oriented solution that solves the problem. Students will also be required to build a hash.

Examples:
[Boat Rental](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week4/boat_rental) |
[Colorado Lottery](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week4/colorado_lottery)

**Weeks 5 and 6**

The week 5 and 6 challenges are a test of a student's knowledge of OOP and Ruby mechanics. They will involve two or three classes that interact, iterating over a hash, and several methods that can't be built with a single enumerable.

The week 5 challenge will be a practice for the final in week 6.

Examples:
[Reunion](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week5/reunion) |
[Museo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod-1-be-exercises/blob/main/practice_independent_challenges/week5/museo)
