Academic success in BEM1 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

**Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference

**Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator

**Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate

A student who promotes from this module will be able to do the following:

## Mastery

* Students will be able to write readable code with the following characteristics:
  * Variable and method names are self explanatory
  * Methods are under 7 lines
  * Lines of code are under 80 characters
  * Project directory structure adheres to convention

**Testing:**

* Students will be able to identify what they should test for in order to verify the expected behavior of a program
* Students will be able to accurately test a piece of functionality by writing appropriate Minitest assertions

**Debugging:**

* Students will be able to diagnose and fix bugs
* Students will be able to explain the meaning of common Ruby error messages
* Students will be able to use Pry to create breakpoints in their code
* Students will be able to identify when variables are in and out of scope

**Version Control:**

* Students will be able to explain the difference between remote and local repositories
* Students will be able to push, pull, commit, and branch using the Git command line interface

**Design:**

* Students will be able to write code that adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles

**Testing:**

* Students will be able to name and order tests so that a test file reads like documentation
* Students will be able to explain what edge case testing is and write tests for those edge cases
* Students will be able to explain the difference between unit and integration testing, and write both types of tests
* Students will be able to implement a stub in an integration test

**Debugging:**
