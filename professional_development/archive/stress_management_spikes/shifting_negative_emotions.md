# Shifting Emotions from Negative to Positive  
Use: Individual

When you feel overwhelmed or stuck with negative emotions, you can utilize this process, which is intended to help you shift your focus from negative emotions to postive ones. Using ideas from [Stress Inoculation Training](http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/learning_modules/psychology/07.TU.09/?section=6) and Barbara Frederickson's research on positive emotions, Sandra L. Foster (PhD, executive coach, and peak performance psychology expert) developed the following coaching technique.

*Note:* This process is meant to be used for temporary relief from stress but does not encompass an in-depth reflection. One of the benefits of this technique is that after completing it, your mind should be more clear and open to other stress management tools. 

### Identify the Negative
Pick out what is causing you to feel negative emotions such as feeling overwhelmed, confused, unfocused, or stressed.

### Reimagine 
Try to imagine this negative state that you're in becoming more positive -- not *how* to achieve this positive state but just imagining a more positive reality. Closing your eyes might be helpful in this step. 

### Brainstorm
Ask yourself -- how might this negative state be changed so that it will be more positive:

    * 3 months from now? 
    * One month from now? 
    * Two weeks from now? 
    * One week from now?
    * One day from now?
Do your feelings about the negative situation feel more positive?

### Write
Brainstorm and write down some positive words or statements strengthen your new positive state. Here are some examples:

    * Breathe
    * Focus
    * I'm OK
    * What is it I am supposed to be doing right now?
    * I can get a grip on my thoughts
    * I've got this
    * Just settle down
    * Smile - it helps
    * I can get on track
    * I can manage this
    * I can break this enormous task down into pieces and tackle each one, step by step
    * What's my task? I can do what I can see/define/clarify
    * We can do it together if we support each other and work together

### Reflect
Do your chosen words generate positive feelings for you? If not, find other positive words. The intention is for your positive words to serve a mantra so that they manifest themselves in your body

### Broaden & Build
Now, develop a "broaden and build" action plan to accompany your positive words, meaning to broaden your personal thought-action repertoires and build your personal resources:

**Make a list** to answer the questions "What do I need to do?" or "What else might help in this situation?"

**Generate different ways to solve the problem,** such as new resources or input from different people. Consider questions like:

* "If I collaborated with ____, what positive outcomes might occur?"
* "What different team interaction might help us better solve this problem?"

**Get perspective.** Step back and consider how this situation might look six months, one year, or even five years from now. What's the picture? Is your perspective too narrow?

### Reconnect to Positive State
Using your positive words and one of the broadening strategies listed above, imagine again the positive state you considered in step 2 keeping these actions in mind. 
    * Do you feel more confident than the first time you imagined it? 
    * Is there anything holding you back from seeing this as a positive state?

### Action Planning & Sharing
Now that you've started to build an action plan, share it with someone you're close with to create a system of accountability and gain any necessary feedback to continue to refine your action plan.
