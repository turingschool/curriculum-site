| Timing        | Facilitator Talking Points        | Participant Actions  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------|
| 5 minutes | Introduce objectives and first writing prompt on the slide. Have students reflect in their journals | Students answer question in journal |
| 15 minutes | Show [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en) on your screen. Ensure that the sound works. Introduction: *We'll start this session today by watching a TED Talk by health psychologist Kelly McGonigal called "How to Make Stress Your Friend"* |  Students watch TED Talk |
| 5 minutes | Introduce: *Today we'll discuss strategies for creating a more mindful approach to dealing with stress. The first step is to identify stress. Take 5 minutes to reflect on anything that may have caused you stress this week by writing about what the root cause might be in your journal.* | Students write in journals |
| 7 minutes | Help students pair up: *You'll partner up with another student for some thought partner coaching. You'll share for 2 minutes uninterrupted about what is stressing you out, and your partner will listen with intention. After the 2 minutes, your partner will repeat back what they heard you say about the cause of your stress, and they may also ask you any clarifying questions. The purpose of this pair coaching is to help each other reflect on what's really happening at the root of your stress.* Announce when 2 minutes is up to have partners switch; provide 1 minute of repeating back and question-asking, then announce for second partner to share. Then students get 1 minute to write any clarifying thoughts in their journals. While students are discussing, write on the board these possible sources of stress: *Pairing (navigating both people and code), Evals, Assessments, Time Management and Workload, Self-care, Time with Family/Friends.* | Students pair up, share with their partners, and write in their journals |
| 20 minutes | Point out the possible sources of stress on the board, and invite students to add to it. Instruct students to self-select into groups based on those topics and point to discussion questions on slide. Instruct groups to assign a timekeeper and notetaker. After 18 minutes, bring the students back together to share takeaways. | Students discuss the prompts in groups. |
| 8 minutes | Instruct students to get their journals again to create goals for the coming week of how they will manage stress. |  Students write in journals |
