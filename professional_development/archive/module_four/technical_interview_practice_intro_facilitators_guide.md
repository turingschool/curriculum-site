# Intro to Technical Interviews: Practice

This session is meant to be an introduction and overview to technical interviews with time for individual practice and review. Follow-up sessions may take the form of straight practice and feedback from instructors.

### Objectives
At the end of this session, students will be able to:

* Describe the goal of a technical interview as demonstrating process
* Identify the different types of technical interview questions that they may be presented with
*

### Deliverable

Students will summarize and reflect on either practice or real interview experiences using these [guidelines](interview_practice_reflection_guidelines)

### Logistics

| Set Up | Materials Needed | PPT Link (if PPT)|
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Computer hooked up to monitor at front of classroom. Use microphone if in Clarke Hall | Pick out a challenge from this [repo](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges) that students haven't worked on before | [Slides to use] |

### Session Outline

Time: 90 minutes

* 30 minutes: Direct instruction
* 30 minutes: Student practice
* 30 minutes: Review and discussion of implementation

Here is a detailed breakdown for this session:

| Timing        | Facilitator Talking Points           | Participant Actions  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 10 minutes | **Hook**: Ask for examples of technical interviews that students have participated in; 2-3 examples from students; after students have shared and offered their insights, ask them what each example had in common? Solicit a few answers and then provide: They were asking for a problem-solving process. Other than that, they may not have had much in common      | Students share information about technical interviews they've participated in; if applicable, students may try to suggest what they would have done in a certain situation, students are responding to facilitator's questions |
| 5 minutes | **Opening:** Description of technical interview approaches: 1. Complete something similar to their product 2. Submit an app according to certain instructions, and then pair with someone during the interview on the submission to add additional features; building on code that you wrote (Thoughtworks does this) 3. Oftentimes, the process is logic questions, puzzles, or demonstrating a basic skill      | Students take notes, ask questions |
| 10 minutes | More information       | Students take notes, ask questions |
| 5 minutes | More information      | Students take notes, ask questions |
| 30 minutes | Introduce a challenge that you've picked out for students to work on. Keep track of time, write it on board, and give verbal updates of time remaining      | Students work on challenge |
| 30 minutes | Live coding of the challenge. Have some parts of it already coded to continue working on or refactor. Ask students specific CFUs around the challenge: why you are doing something a certain way, etc. Ask for other ideas of implementation      | Students follow along and provide answers/ideas |


What do the hiring managers ultimately care about? Whole group: thought process; don’t care about your knowledge

Key points
Key point: Going to a technical interview is about your process not your knowledge
Don’t waste time talking about what you don’t know; you’re not supposed to know all the things but you are supposed to have a good process
Biggest lesson from Turing -- how to get unstuck when you’re stuck
What are the repeatable processes that you can use when you’re stuck?
Why do they care about process?
What are hiring managers scared of?
They’re scared that they’ll have to spend a lot of time answering your questions OR you pretend you know everything instead of asking questions; it could turn into serious productivity and billing issues
Having a good process shows that you’re employable
Tough Example:
If you get a technical challenge that is sent to you and asked to provide in 48 hours --
Good option: send a completed thing, even if it’s not great
Best option: send something half done but done well
You always have the opportunity to show that you’re a professional software developer
Time for questions
How do you demonstrate process in a take-home beyond git workflow?
Start it as soon as you can -- that way you can ask questions if there’s something missing; show them that you’re on top of it -- the earlier you ask the questions, the better response you’ll get
Make a schedule
Use Git -- do commits in a couple stages if you haven’t committed in a while; be able to tell the story of what you worked on
Examples from students:
Didn’t have time to do testing, but she did write a very detailed ReadMe; sent the interviewer also log of Git commits; she didn’t finish the app but was able to show him her entire process

Content of interviews
Puzzles (random)
Complex application of certain techniques (specific domain topics)
Computer Science -- aka data manipulation
Examples

Review
You’re doing this interview to show your process, mitigate risk, how will you execute when you’re given hard things to do
Programming is hard work 99% of the time, moments of success 1% of the time

Do (30 mins)
Students work on a challenge from this repo
Have a challenge ready that students haven’t used before

Review Implementation and Questions (30 mins)
Discuss process and implementation
