# Cold Outreach I

[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y8hYW1Szs6xaOkrcWfvsI2sFYN8Lw1fjgJBbwGO0c6k/edit?usp=sharing)

### Objectives
* Understand why cold outreach is effective for establishing professional relationships
* Implement strategies to contact mentors, alumni, and/or professional contacts who you'd like to meet
* Build a sustainable and meaningful relationship with a mentor

### Deliverable
You'll be expected to give a synopsis of your cold outreach interactions following these [guidelines](./cold_outreach_i_guidelines) via the [PD submissions repo](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions)

### Opening
In the technology industry, moreso than in other industries, getting ahead in your career comes down to who you know. Establishing strong connections with those in the technology community starts while you're at Turing.

This is the first of two sessions about outreach. While this session is called Cold Outreach, we'll be looking at contacts within the Turing community, so this is more of "warm outreach," and it will give you experience and confidence to be able to build on your network and intiate true cold outreach during Module 4. Thus, your first objective as part of your networking practice is to make connections with others in the Turing community by utilizing our extensive mentorship community.

### The Why
**Why should I reach out to mentors?**
For one, they are already a part of your community here and can provide a wealth of knowledge to you not only on how to be successful at Turing but important information on entering the software industry. They also **want** you to reach out to them -- they've volunteered to be a part of the mentorship program.

**Why cold outreach? Why can't mentors just be assigned to students?**
First, we don't have the bandwidth to assign mentors. And even if we did, who's to say we'd create the best match for you? Learning how to reach out to others and create a network is an important skill for you to be successful in this industry, and it is also how you'll create the most meaningful relationships possible.

**Discussion:**
Show of hands of who in the class has reached out to mentors and who hasn't.

* For those who haven't reached out, what has held you back from reaching out to mentors in the past?
* For those who have reached out to mentors, what are your takeaways from the experience so far?

### Finding the Right People
The strategies discussed here can be applied to reaching out to anyone, but again, we'll focus on mentors in this particular session. Before you start reaching out to just anyone, ask yourself "what would I like to get out of a mentor relationship?"

Possible answers:

* Project help
* Drills and homework help
* Learning about the industry
* Technical and/or behavioral prep
* Emotional support
* Learning about specific jobs/companies
* Learning about the tech scene in a certain location

Answering these questions could lead you to a long list of ideas -- this is totally fine. But take time to prioritize your needs that are the most pressing right now. Start with that highest priority.

Now, go to the [mentorship spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxsATOSIdRZ78-Bj3GQY2LkIp0OV_sCN6GJVjtUuCl0/edit?usp=sharing) to find 1-3 people who fit your answer(s).

Other things to keep in mind:

* Is your contact in Denver or remote?
* Does their schedule match up with yours?

Have an idea of how you would set up a meeting with a mentor before you contact them.

### Actual Email Formatting
When you're ready to write your email (or Slack message), here are some things to keep in mind:

**Less is More:**

* Keep it short (5-7 sentences)
* Be direct and make it easy for them -- can they respond to you in one sentence?

**Email Format:**

* Keep it casual -- no "To Whom It May Concern"
* ...But not *too* casual
* Draw a connection between you and the person on the receiving end -- why did you pick that person to reach out to?
* Don't tell your life story. That can come when you actually meet the person. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point
* Utilize the subject line

**Email Purpose:**

What do you want to talk about? Go back to your highest priorities listed above.

With mentors:

* Set expectations for the initial meeting. Your relationship will grow from there

When you're ready to apply this to industry contacts, you may also consider:

* Informational interviews
* Visit their company and tour their office
* Company's process for hiring junior developers

**Examples**:

Example #1:

    Hi Jose,

    My name is Gaby, and I'm a module two student in the Back End program at Turing. I'm originally
    from Chicago and would love to move back there after I graduate. I'd really like to connect
    with you to discuss your work and the tech scene there. I'm particularly interested in any advice
    you have for how I can prepare for my job search in Chicago. I noticed on your schedule that you are
    available Wednesdays at 5pm -- are you free next Wednesday the 28th? If so, I can set up Google
    Hangout. If that date/time doesn't work for you, please let me know a time that's better for you.

    Thanks,
    Gaby Martinez

What do you notice about this email? What is working well? What would you do differently?

Example #2:

    Hi Jenna,

    I'm reaching out because I'm currently in Mod Two of the Front End program at Turing. I'm starting
    to learn React and figured it's about time I find a mentor. I saw that you work in React, and as I
    start to use it more in my projects, I would really appreciate any guidance you might be able to give
    me. Are you available to meet at Turing this Thursday (6/2) at 4pm? If not, please
    let me know a better date/time we could meet!

    Thanks,

Example #3: *This email is not to a mentor but rather leveraging a mentor relationship for a "colder" contact*

    Hi Mark,

    My name is Katrina, and I'm a back end student at Turing. Our mutual connection Shauna Williams
    recommended I reach out to ask you about your work at Tech Choice. I'm very interested in pursuing
    work at a start-up like that and would really appreciate any advice you have for me as I start out as a junior dev. I       saw that you've posted in the Turing job hunt channel about senior positions opening up at Tech Choice. Any chance
    you'll be hiring junior devs soon? I'd love to talk with you about that too. What's your schedule like next week? I am
    free on Tuesday afternoon. We could meet at Dazbog off of Curtis and 18th.

    Thanks,
    Katrina Johnson

### What Not to Do
It's definitely exciting (or excruciating, depending on your initial viewpoint) to reach out to someone new from the industry. But make sure you don't let your nerves get the best of you. More than anything, do your research.

**Don't:**

* Pick the first name on the list. Again, do your research
* Spell the mentor's name wrong
* Bull shit. Contacts can tell when you haven't done enough research about what it is you want to connect about
* Give up if you don't get an immediate response. Mentors are busy. If you reached out using Slack, try their email next
* Pretend you're an expert when you're not. They're called "mentors" for a reason -- ask questions!

### Research & Execution Time

* If you haven't looked at the mentor sheet yet, spend time researching who you'd like to reach out to and then craft a message

* If you have already been meeting with a mentor regularly, find someone else from the sheet to reach out to based on your professional interests. Draft your email following the strategies above.

### Closing & Next Steps

Remember that the mentors **want** to hear from you, and you can create more than one mentor relationship

With these tools, you're expected to create a mentor relationship, and you're also expected to start building a network from contacts available at Turing.

One of your deliverables in Module 4 is to write cold outreach emails to contacts from companies you're interested in. Use these strategies to build your comfort in cold outreach so that you'll be prepared to take the next step of applying them to your job search.
