## Opening
Recap project management and agile practices:

* Waterfall vs. Agile
* Tuckman's
* Waffle
* Git Workflow

How do these practices relate to the success of a team?

## Leadership in Teams
**Discuss Chapter 4: Ask Questions Instead of Giving Direct Orders in small groups:**

* What was this chapter about?
* Do you agree with this approach? Why/why not?
* What does it mean to be a good leader?
* How can you replicate this approach within teams at Turing?

**Whole Group Discussion: Project Managers**

Building off of your small group discussion, how would you define the role of the project manager?

Back in your small groups, define the role of the project manager for your group.

**Goal-Planning Activity:**

	SCENARIO: Your group discussed skill levels and expectations in your DTR, and during the first iteration
	of Bike Share, Teammate A drives while Teammate B navigates and (if applicable) Teammate C looks up
	documentation. Teammate A insists on going down a route he/she claims to feel comfortable with. Teammate B
	asks a few questions, looking confused, but then falls silent as Teammate A continues to drive and gives
	little explanation for what he/she is doing. Teammate C vocalizes that he/she has found a better way
	to complete the iteration based on some documentation, but Teammate A answers that his/her way will be
	better. During the group’s next check-in, Teammate A presents the code he/she produced, takes credit for
	it, and the other teammates sit silently. Discuss what should be done in this situation as a team.


How can the project manager help in this situation? What would you do if Teammate A was your project manager?

## How to Handle Failure:
**Discuss Chapter 5: Mitigate Fault in small groups:**

* What was this chapter about?
* What does it look like to actually learn from and move past mistakes?
* Why did I have you read this?

**Whole Group Debrief:**

How can this chapter be applied to software teams?

**Fear-Planning Activity:**

	SCENARIO: During your DTR for your project, Teammate A expresses that he/she wants to take on some new
	features that he/she has never done before. Teammates B and (if applicable) C aren’t sure about this.
	There is so much to get done, they want to just stick to what they know how to do well. What system can
	your team create to allow team members to take risks and try out new things in the project? What will
	your team do if Teammate A “fails”? How will your team communicate?

	Discuss the above scenario using the prompts below:
		* Acknowledge that failure happens. How can we do that in our team? What will that look like?
		* Encourage dialogue to foster trust. How can you establish honest communication within your
		team?
		* Separate the person from the failure. How can you create a sense of safety in your team? How
		will you mitigate fault?
		* Learn from your mistakes. How can you turn a mistake into an opportunity?
		* Create a risk-taking and failure system. How can you make your team a safe place to take risks?

## Individual Reflections
Answer these questions in your journal:

* How will you use your strengths in your Bike Share team?
* Continue fear-planning by creating individual goals for yourself:
	* How can you help the team learn from and move past mistakes?
	* What efforts can you personally take to ensure you don’t blame others for “failures”? What could you do instead?
