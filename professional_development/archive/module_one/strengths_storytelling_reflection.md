# Strengths & Storytelling Reflection Guidelines

Build on your professional story by thinking about how you're progressing at Turing. Answer the questions below in your own gist to use your StrengthsFinder themes to add to your story:

* Look at your initial StrengthsFinder reflection that you completed in week 1 -- how have your perceptions of the top 5 themes changed?

* How are you different today than when you first started at Turing? Where are you stronger now than on day 1?

* Considering how you describe these themes, how do you want others to see you as you continue to progress through Turing?

* How might these themes play a role in describing your Turing story?

* Even though your Turing story isn't finished yet, what do you envision for your development in future mods? How will this story end?
